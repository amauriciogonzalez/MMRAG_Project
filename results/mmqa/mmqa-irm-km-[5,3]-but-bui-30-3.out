Question: when was last time dodgers played yankees in the world series
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dodgers–Yankees rivalry. Fact: The Dodgers–Yankees rivalry is a Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Dodgers are a member club of the National League (NL) West division, and the Yankees are a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The rivalry between the Dodgers and Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues. The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States. The Dodgers currently lead the regular season series 7-6. Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings, the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981. They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a 3-game interleague series. Nevertheless, games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds.

2. Title: 1956 World Series. Fact: The 1956 World Series of Major League Baseball was played between the New York Yankees (representing the American League) and the defending champion Brooklyn Dodgers (representing the National League) during October 1956. The Series was a rematch of the 1955 World Series. It was the last all-New York City Series until 44 years later in 2000; the Dodgers and the New York Giants moved to California after the 1957 season. Additionally, it was the last time a New York team represented the National League until 1969 when the New York Mets defeated the Baltimore Orioles in five games.

3. Title: 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season. Fact: The 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 127th for the franchise in Major League Baseball, and their 59th season in Los Angeles, California. They began the season with a new manager in Dave Roberts. The Dodgers in 2016 set a new Major League record for the most players placed on the disabled list in one season. On September 25, they clinched their fourth consecutive National League West division championship, the first team in the division ever to do so and defeated the Washington Nationals in five games in the Division Series. They were defeated by the Chicago Cubs; the eventual World Series champion, in six games in the National League Championship Series. This was the 67th and final season for Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully.

4. Title: 2017 American League Championship Series. Fact: The 2017 American League Championship Series was a best-of-seven playoff pitting the Houston Astros against the New York Yankees for the American League pennant and the right to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 World Series. The Astros defeated the Yankees in seven games after falling behind three games to two. The home team won every game in the series.

Question: when did the first episode of phineas and ferb come out
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Phineas and Ferb. Fact: Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy ("Agent P") for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

Question: is make your own kind of music on an album
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Make Your Own Kind of Music (song). Fact: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" is a pop song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, first recorded in 1968 by the New York City-based trio the Will-O-Bees (Janet Blossom, Steven Porter, and Robert Merchanthouse), who regularly performed Mann/Weil compositions. After Cass Elliot had a hit in the summer of 1969 with Mann/Weil's "It's Getting Better", she recorded "Make Your Own Kind of Music" as the follow-up single, and her album Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama was re-released as "Make Your Own Kind Of Music/It's Getting Better," the title cut having been added to the original track listing. However, Elliot's "Make Your Own Kind of Music" single only reached No. 36. The similar chart impact of the follow-up single, another Mann/Weil composition entitled "New World Coming," which reached No. 42, signaled Elliot's challenges in maintaining a profile as a current hitmaker, as the 1960s turned into the 1970s. The Cass Elliot track is in the key of E major.

2. Title: Make Your Own Kind of Music (TV series). Fact: The key concept of the series was that each show starts off with the letter "A". The first show started off with "A is for Alpert", as Herb Alpert stood next to a big letter "A", and introduced the show. The cast would then go down the alphabet list, and when they got to "Z", the show would end.

Question: who owns the rights to little shop of horrors
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Little Shop of Horrors (film). Fact: Little Shop of Horrors was the first DVD to be recalled for content. In 1998, Warner Bros. released a special edition DVD that contained approximately 23 minutes of unfinished footage from Oz's original ending, although it was in black and white and was missing some sound, visual and special effects.[citation needed] Producer and rights owner David Geffen was not aware of this release until it made it to the stores. Geffen said, "They put out a black-and-white, un-scored, un-dubbed video copy of the original ending that looked like shit." As a result, the studio removed it from shelves in a matter of days and replaced it with a second edition that did not contain the extra material. Geffen wanted to theatrically re-release the film with the original ending intact. Geffen also claimed to have a color copy of the original ending, while the studio had lower quality, black and white duplicates as their own color print was destroyed in a studio fire years earlier. But Geffen had not known, until after the DVD was pulled, that the studio did not know there was a colored copy of the original ending in existence.

2. Title: The Little Shop of Horrors. Fact: The film stars Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, and Dick Miller, all of whom had worked for Corman on previous films. Produced under the title "The Passionate People Eater", the film employs an original style of humor, combining black comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof. "The Little Shop of Horrors" was shot on a budget of $28,000 (about $240,000 in 2019), with interiors being shot in two days utilizing sets that had been left standing from "A Bucket of Blood".

3. Title: The Little Shop of Horrors. Fact: The Little Shop of Horrors is a 1960 American comedy film directed by Roger Corman. Written by Charles B. Griffith, the film is a farce about an inadequate florist's assistant who cultivates a plant that feeds on human blood. The film's concept is thought to be based on a 1932 story called "Green Thoughts", by John Collier, about a man-eating plant. However, Dennis McDougal suggests that Griffith may have been influenced by Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi short story from 1956, "The Reluctant Orchid" (which was in turn inspired by the 1905 H. G. Wells story "The Flowering of the Strange Orchid").

The event took place on July 12, 2010 at the Plaza de Toros Lauro Luis Longoria bullring and commemorated the 1st anniversary of Promociones Gutierrez. The focal point of the event was a Ruleta de la Muerte (Spanish for "Roulette of Death") tournament, in which five teams of Parejas Incredibles (teams of enemies) participate in an elimination match to see which team would have to face off in a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match. The team of Místico and El Oriental lost the Ruleta de la Muerte and was forced to wrestle each other immediately after the Ruleta match. In the end Místico defeated El Oriental to unmask him.

The focal point of the show and the inspiration for the event name was the main event steel cage match between four trios teams with each group "betting" something on the outcome of the match. Under the rules of the match the last wrestler in the cage would be deemed the loser along with his partners, losing their "bet", while the second to last person in the ring would be declared the winners of the same bet. "Los Psycho Circus" (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) placed their IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship on the line. The remaining groups all placed their wrestling mask or hair on the line and would either unmask or be shaved bald if their team lost. The last three teams were; "Los Perros del Mal" (Bestia 666, Damián 666 and X-Fly), "Los Villanos" (Kortiz, Ray Mendoza, Jr. and Villano IV) and "Los Nuevo Temerarios" (Black Terry, Durok, Machín). Some of the matches were taped for televisiona and shown on TVC Deportes on December 25, 2011.

Question: what comic was roy of the rovers in
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Roy of the Rovers (comic). Fact: The Roy of the Rovers comic was launched as a weekly on 25 September 1976, named after the established comic strip of the same name that first appeared as weekly feature in the Tiger on 11 September 1954. The title ran for 853 issues, until 20 March 1993[nb 1] (industrial action prevented publication of 3 issues in December 1978 and a further 5 in May and June 1980), and included other football strips and features. In February 1989, the comic merged with the similarly themed Hot Shot, and was known for a brief time as Roy of the Rovers and Hot Shot, but reverted to its original title shortly afterwards.

2. Title: Tom Tully (writer). Fact: Tom Tully was a noted British comic writer mostly of sports and action stories. He is probably most famous as the longest-running writer of the popular football-themed strip "Roy of the Rovers", which he wrote for much of Roy Race's playing career until the weekly comic closed in 1993.

Question: what does the sun symbolize in the philippine flag
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flag of the Philippines. Fact: The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty, equality, and fraternity; a horizontal blue stripe for peace, truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism and valor. In the center of the white triangle is an eight-rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people's democracy, and sovereignty. Each ray represents a province with significant involvement in the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain; these provinces are Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Bataan, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija (some sources specify other provinces as alternatives to some of these[a]). However, according to the Declaration of Independence and a research by UP Professor Ambeth Ocampo, the rays of the sun symbolized the first 8 provinces of the Philippines which was declared under martial law during the First Philippine Revolution. Three five-pointed stars, one for each of the triangle's points, stand for the three major island groups where the revolution started: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Question: Leopold VI, was the Duke of Syria from 1194, and had the title of which medieval principality, of the Holy Roman Empire, from 1198 to his death in 1230?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Leopold VI, Duke of Austria. Fact: Leopold VI (German: Luitpold VI. von Österreich, 1176 – 28 July 1230), known as Leopold the Glorious (German: Luitpold der Glorreiche), was the Duke of Styria from 1194 and the Duke of Austria from 1198 to his death in 1230. He was a member of the House of Babenberg. He was also a member of the Chapter of the Cistercian Order. Like his predecessors, he attempted to develop the land by founding monasteries. His most important foundation is Lilienfeld in the Lower Austrian valley of the Traisen river, where he was buried after his death. Besides that, he supported the then highly modern Mendicant Orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans.  He is arguably one of the greatest of the Babenbergs.

2. Title: Lothair I. Fact: Lothair I or Lothar I (Dutch and Medieval Latin: "Lotharius", German: "Lothar", French: "Lothaire", Italian: "Lotario") (795 – 29 September 855) was the Holy Roman Emperor (817–855, co-ruling with his father until 840), and the governor of Bavaria (815–817), King of Italy (818–855) and Middle Francia (840–855).

Question: Queen Mab, is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet", where "she is the fairies' midwife", in her play, her activity is described in a famous speech by which fictional character in William Shakespeare's 1597 tragedy, a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Queen Mab. Fact: Queen Mab (pronunciation: "M/ă/v")[citation needed] is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, where "she is the fairies' midwife."  Later, she appears in other poetry and literature, and in various guises in drama and cinema. In the play, her activity is described in a famous speech by Mercutio written originally in prose and often adapted into iambic pentameter, in which she is described as a miniature creature who performs midnight pranks upon sleepers.  Being driven by a team of atomies, she rides her chariot over their noses and "delivers the fancies of sleeping men."  Additionally, while driving "O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream," she was known to change her mind and instead "plague" "ladies' lips" "with blisters" if she smelled "sweetmeats" or candied fruit eaten to sweeten their breath.  Along with this interpretation, others[who?] believe the blisters were a reference to the plague or to herpes simplex. She is also described as a midwife to help sleepers 'give birth' to their dreams. She may be a figure borrowed from folklore, and though she is often associated with the Irish Medb in popular culture, and has been suggested by historian Thomas Keightley to be from Habundia, a more likely origin for her name would be from Mabel and the Middle English derivative "Mabily" (as used by Chaucer) all from the Latin amabilis ("lovable").

2. Title: Mercutio. Fact: Mercutio (/mərˈkjuːʃioʊ/ mər-KEW-shee-oh) is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's 1597 tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. He is a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris. As such, being neither a Montague nor a Capulet, Mercutio is one of the few in Verona with the ability to mingle around those of both houses. The invitation to Capulet's party states that he has a brother named Valentine.

3. Title: Sycorax. Fact: Sycorax is an unseen character in William Shakespeare's play "The Tempest" (1611). She is a vicious and powerful witch and the mother of Caliban, one of the few native inhabitants of the island on which Prospero, the hero of the play, is stranded. She is originally from 'Argier,' defined by geographer Mohamed. S. E. Madiou as "a 16th and 17th century older English-based exonym for both the 16th and 17th c. capital and state of ‘Algiers’ (Argier/Argier)," from where Sycorax is banished.

4. Title: Ophelia. Fact: Ophelia  is a character in William Shakespeare's drama "Hamlet". She is a young noblewoman of Denmark, the daughter of Polonius, sister of Laertes, and potential wife of Prince Hamlet.



Answer the following question: 'Queen Mab, is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet", where "she is the fairies' midwife", in her play, her activity is described in a famous speech by which fictional character in William Shakespeare's 1597 tragedy, a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris?'

1. Title: Wig. Fact: A wig is a head covering made from human hair, animal hair, or synthetic fiber. The word wig is short for periwig, which makes its earliest known appearance in the English language in William Shakespeare's "The Two Gentlemen of Verona".

Question: How many columns are at the front of The Old Vic theatre?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Old Vic. Fact: The Old Vic is a 1,000-seat, not-for-profit producing theatre, located just south-east of Waterloo station on the corner of the Cut and Waterloo Road in Lambeth, London, England. Established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg Theatre, and renamed in 1833 the Royal Victoria Theatre, in 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the Royal Victoria Palace. It was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 and formally named the Royal Victoria Hall, although by that time it was already known as the "Old Vic". In 1898, a niece of Cons', Lilian Baylis, assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914. The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after it reopened.

Question: Whom between  Natasha Zvereva and Raúl Ramírez did Gigi Fernández win the most Grand Slam double's championships with?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Raúl Ramírez. Fact: Raúl Ramírez (born 20 June 1953) is a retired Mexican professional tennis player. He was active during the 1970s and 1980s, and is regarded as one of the great all-around players of the modern era.[citation needed] Ramírez was also the first player to finish first in both singles and doubles Grand Prix point standings, accomplishing the feat in 1976. He attended and played tennis at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

2. Title: Natasha Zvereva. Fact: Natasha Zvereva, or Zverava, (born Natallya Maratawna Zverava; Belarusian: Наталля Маратаўна Зверава; 16 April 1971) is a former tennis player from Belarus. She was the first major athlete in the Soviet Union to demand publicly that she should be able to keep her tournament earnings. The team of Zvereva and Gigi Fernández won more women's doubles titles and Grand Slam women's doubles championships than any other team since that of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver.

3. Title: List of Grand Slam women's doubles champions. Fact: The only pairing to complete the "Grand Slam" is the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver in 1984, and their eight consecutive slam win streak still stands as the all-time record. Maria Bueno in 1960 and Martina Hingis in 1998 won the yearly grand slam with various partners in the slams. Four players have completed a career doubles golden-slam by winning a gold medal at the Olympics and all four Majors during their respective careers: Venus Williams and Serena Williams paired together, and individually Pam Shriver and Gigi Fernández.

Question: The film "Alamo: The Price of Freedom" was about what 19th century American pioneer born in 1796, who had a pivotal role in the Texas Revolution and died at the Battle of the Alamo, and in the film was played by Steve Sandor?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Alamo: The Price of Freedom. Fact: Alamo: The Price of Freedom is a 1988 American IMAX film starring Merrill Connally as Davy Crockett, Casey Biggs as William Barret Travis, Enrique Sandino as Antonio López de Santa Anna, Steve Sandor as James Bowie, Don Swayze as James Bonham, and Derek Caballero as Juan Seguín. It was written and directed by Kieth Merrill and distributed by Macgillivray Freeman Films. It is based on the George A. McAlister book of the same name. At the time of its filming, the production generated much controversy among the Tejano population of San Antonio who protested that it was demeaning to their contributions to the city's history. It is shown at San Antonio's IMAX in Theater Rivercenter.

2. Title: James Bowie. Fact: James "Jim" Bowie (pronounced /ˈbuːiː/ BOO-ee) (c. 1796 – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American pioneer, who played a prominent role in the Texas Revolution, culminating in his death at the Battle of the Alamo. Stories of him as a fighter and frontiersman, both real and fictitious, have made him a legendary figure in Texas history and a folk hero of American culture.

3. Title: Martyrs of the Alamo. Fact: Martyrs of the Alamo (also known as The Birth of Texas) is a 1915 American historical war drama film written and directed by Christy Cabanne. The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including Sam De Grasse, Douglas Fairbanks, Walter Long and Alfred Paget.

The film features the Siege of Béxar, Battle of the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto.

4. Title: Heroes of the Alamo. Fact: Unlike other Alamo films that concentrate on Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, the main protagonists are Almaron (Bruce Warren) and Susanna Dickinson (Ruth Findlay) and their daughter Angelina (Marilyn Haslett). The film gives a fictionalised fast moving account of the restriction on American emigration to Texas, the arrest of Stephen F. Austin by Santa Anna (Julian Rivero), Sam Houston (Edward Piel) appointed General to build the Texian Army, and Dickinson's participation in both the Battle of Gonzales and the Battle of the Alamo.

5. Title: The Alamo (2004 film). Fact: The Alamo is a 2004 American war film about the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. The film was directed by Texan John Lee Hancock, produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, and Mark Johnson, distributed by Touchstone Pictures, and starring Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett, and Jason Patric as Jim Bowie.

Question: The actress married to Roger Davis who was offered the role of Victoria Winters is best known for her role as what character in "Charlie's Angels"?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Victoria Winters. Fact: Victoria "Vicky" Winters is a fictional character from the television Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows and its remakes of the same name. The role was originated by Alexandra Moltke on the ABC series from 1966 to 1968. After Moltke left to raise a family in 1968, actresses Betsy Durkin and Carolyn Groves briefly replaced her for only a handful of episodes, before Victoria was written out completely. Jaclyn Smith, who was married to Dark Shadows actor Roger Davis at the time, was offered the role when Moltke left the show, but she declined.

2. Title: Jaclyn Smith. Fact: Jaclyn Ellen Smith (born October 26, 1945) is an American actress and businesswoman. She is known for her role as Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels (1976–81), and was the only original female lead to remain with the series for its complete run. She reprised the role with a cameo appearance in the 2003 film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Her other films include Nightkill (1980) and Déjà Vu (1985). Beginning in the 1980s, she began developing and marketing her own brands of clothing and perfume.

3. Title: Farrah Fawcett. Fact: Fawcett began her career in the 1960s appearing in commercials and guest roles on television. During the 1970s, she appeared in numerous television series, including recurring roles on "Harry O" (1974–1976), and "The Six Million Dollar Man" (1974–1978) with her first husband, film and television star Lee Majors. Her breakthrough role came in 1976 when she was cast as Jill Munroe in "Charlie's Angels", alongside Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith. The show propelled all three to stardom, but especially Fawcett, who was then billed as "Farrah Fawcett-Majors". After appearing only in the first season, she decided to leave the show, but returned as a guest star in six episodes during the show's third and fourth seasons (1978–1980). For her role in "Charlie's Angels", she received her first Golden Globe nomination. In 1983, Fawcett received positive reviews for her performance in the Off-Broadway play "Extremities". She was subsequently cast in the 1986 film version and received a Golden Globe nomination. She received two Emmy Award nominations for her roles in TV movies, as a battered wife in the 1984 film "The Burning Bed" and as real-life murderer Diane Downs in the 1989 film "Small Sacrifices". Her 1980s work in TV movies also earned her four additional Golden Globe nominations.

Hotel features one of the most expansive sets in American Horror Story history, with production designer Mark Worthington building two stories on a soundstage, along with a working elevator and stairway. In July 2015, FX launched a marketing campaign for the series, with most trailers and teasers touting Gaga's involvement.

Question: steven universe save the light how many players
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Steven Universe: Save the Light. Fact: Save the Light features seven playable characters from the series, Steven, Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl, Connie, Greg and Peridot, with an eighth character to be added in a future content update; four characters can be equipped to a party at a time. The game has a "blend of real-time and turn-based combat", and more of a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving more than its predecessor. Players are able to explore Beach City and surrounding areas, and engage in battles with enemies. During battle, the players' actions, which include attacking and defending, will build up the star meter which allows the characters to pull off more powerful moves. A new feature allows characters to build up a relationship-based meter during battles and dialogue interactions; when filled, characters are able to fuse, such as Steven and Connie into Stevonnie.

2. Title: Steven Universe: Attack the Light. Fact: "Attack the Light" is a simplified role-playing game in which Steven and the three Crystal Gems—Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl — travel across five color-themed worlds. Players move across the map by swiping the touchscreen and can interact with chests, mechanisms, and hidden areas to obtain items that can either be used in battle or to open up other areas. Some areas may be inaccessible until players solve a puzzle or obtain the necessary item from another level.

Question: a solar system has four earth-size terrestrial planets
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Terrestrial planet. Fact: The Solar System has four terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Only one terrestrial planet, Earth, is known to have an active hydrosphere.

2. Title: Solar System. Fact: The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

3. Title: Giant planet. Fact: A giant planet is any massive planet. They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist. There are four known giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.

4. Title: Solar System. Fact: The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.

Question: What ancient kingdom built several temples to the Egyptian god Amun in what is now Sudan and South Sudan?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Kawa (Sudan). Fact: Kawa is a site in Sudan, located between the Third and Fourth Cataracts of the Nile on the east bank of the river, across from Dongola. In ancient times it was the site of several temples to the Egyptian god Amun, built by the Egyptian rulers Amenhotep III and Tutankhamun, and by Taharqa and other Kushite kings.

2. Title: Kingdom of Kush. Fact: The Kingdom of Kush or Kush (/kʊʃ, kʌʃ/) was an ancient kingdom in Nubia, located at the confluences of the Blue Nile, White Nile and River Atbara in what is now Sudan and South Sudan.

3. Title: Karnak. Fact: The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (, from Arabic "Khurnak" meaning "fortified village"), comprises a vast mix of decayed temples, chapels, pylons, and other buildings near Luxor, in Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I in the Middle Kingdom and continued into the Ptolemaic period, although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian "Ipet-isut" ("The Most Selected of Places") and the main place of worship of the eighteenth dynasty Theban Triad with the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes. The Karnak complex gives its name to the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, north of Luxor.

Question: No.11 Group was a part of which air force that emerged as the largest air force in the world in 1918?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: No. 11 Group RAF. Fact: No. 11 Group was a group in the Royal Air Force for various periods in the 20th century, finally disbanding in 1996. Its most famous service was during 1940 when it defended London and the south-east against the attacks of the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain.

2. Title: 11th Bomb Squadron. Fact: The 11th is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, first being organized as the 11th Aero Squadron on 26 June 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to France and fought on the Western Front during World War I as a Day Bombardment squadron. It took part in the St. Mihiel offensive and the Meuse-Argonne offensive.

3. Title: Jagdstaffel 11. Fact: Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 11 ("No 11 Fighter Squadron"; commonly abbreviated to Jasta 11) was founded on 28 September 1916 from elements of 4 Armee's "Kampfeinsitzerkommandos" (or KEKs) 1, 2 and 3 and mobilized on 11 October as part of the German Air Service's expansion program, forming permanent specialised fighter squadrons, or ""Jastas"". It became the most successful fighter squadron in the "Luftstreitkräfte".

4. Title: Royal Air Force. Fact: The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.

Question: Get Your Phil includes which song written by Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Get Your Phil. Fact: Get Your Phil is the sixth studio album released by Disappear Fear. This release marks the return of the harmonizing vocals of sisters: Sonia Rutstein (SONiA) and Cindy Frank (CiNDY); which have not been featured since the group's 1996 album, Seed in the Sahara. The album has been described as, "100% made in America, folk music." All tracks are songs written by Phil Ochs, except for "Because the Night" which was penned by Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen. The album was released on July 4, 2011. Cindy said of the release date, "We think a new anti-war album released on Independence Day is a great idea and we hope that Phil would be proud." The majority of the instrumentation on the album is done by Sonia. She plays the acoustic guitar, piano and harmonica. The album was engineered and produced by Grammy nominee, John Jacob.

2. Title: Because the Night. Fact: "Because the Night" is a song written by Bruce Springsteen with some of the words changed by Patti Smith that was first released in 1978 as a single off the Patti Smith Group album Easter. It rose to number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as number five in the United Kingdom, and helped propel sales of Easter to mainstream success—even as Smith was deciding to retire from a life of constant touring. In 1987, the song was ranked number 116 on NME magazine's list of "The Top 150 Singles of All Time". It remains one of the best-known songs of Smith's catalog.

3. Title: Clovis (given name). Fact: Clovis is the modern conventional French (and thence English) form of the Old Frankish name *"Hlōdowik" "famous in battle" (Old High German: "Chlodowig") equivalent to the modern forms Louis (French), Lodewijk (Dutch), Lewis (English), and Ludwig (German).

Question: shield volcanoes tend to erupt what type of lava
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shield volcano. Fact: A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid (low viscosity) lava they erupt which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava.

2. Title: List of shield volcanoes. Fact: Shield Volcanoes are one of the three types of volcanoes. They have a short cone shape, and have basaltic lava which means the lava has low viscosity (viscosity is a measure of the ability for a liquid to flow)

3. Title: Pyroclastic shield. Fact: In volcanology, a pyroclastic shield or ignimbrite shield is an uncommon type of shield volcano. Unlike most shield volcanoes, pyroclastic shields are formed mostly of pyroclastic and highly explosive eruptions rather than relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano.

1. Title: Saturday Night Live Samurai. Fact: In the early years of Saturday Night Live, John Belushi portrayed an archetypal samurai — he had a dedicated concept of honor, spoke only (mock) Japanese, and wielded a katana. Sketches featuring the character showed him in different occupations that would not be expected for a samurai. He always performed his tasks perfectly, despite scaring his clients quite a few times. The character was modeled after Toshiro Mifune's character in Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo.

2. Title: John Belushi. Fact: John Adam Belushi (/bəˈluːʃi/; January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor and musician. Belushi is best known for his "intense energy and raucous attitude" which he displayed as one of the seven original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's The Second City comedy club.

3. Title: Damon Wayans. Fact: Damon Kyle Wayans Sr. (; born September 4, 1960) is an American comedian, actor, writer, and producer, and member of the Wayans family of entertainers. Wayans performed as a comedian and actor throughout the 1980s, including a year long stint on the sketch comedy series "Saturday Night Live."

Question: is the nightmare before christmas a disney movie
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Nightmare Before Christmas. Fact: The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Burton began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney released the film through Touchstone Pictures because the studio believed the film would be "too dark and scary for kids".

2. Title: The Nightmare Before Christmas (soundtrack). Fact: The Nightmare Before Christmas is the fifteenth soundtrack album by American composer Danny Elfman. It was released on October 12, 1993, by Walt Disney Records to promote the 1993 American stop-motion animated musical dark fantasy film "The Nightmare Before Christmas". Composed by Danny Elfman, the soundtrack was nominated for the 1993 Golden Globe for Best Original Score. The album peaked at #64 on the US "Billboard" 200. For the film's 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, a bonus disc which contained covers of five of the film's songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks (six on the Best Buy exclusive) by Elfman were also included.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Facial muscles. Fact: The facial muscles are just under the skin (subcutaneous) muscles that control facial expression. They generally originate from the surface of the skull bone (rarely the fascia), and insert on the skin of the face. When they contract, the skin moves. These muscles also cause wrinkles at right angles to the muscles’ action line.

Question: who played gale sayers in brian's song
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Brian's Song (2001 film). Fact: Brian's Song is the 2001 remake of the 1971 television film "Brian's Song", telling the story of Brian Piccolo (Sean Maher), a white running back who meets, clashes with and befriends fellow Chicago Bears running back Gale Sayers (Mekhi Phifer). The movie was adapted from Sayers' own words in his autobiography, "I am Third". The television movie, produced by Columbia TriStar Television, was first broadcast in the US on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC.

2. Title: Brian's Song. Fact: Brian's Song is a 1971 ABC Movie of the Week that recounts the details of the life of Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan), a Wake Forest University football player stricken with terminal cancer after turning pro, told through his friendship with Chicago Bears teammate Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams). Piccolo's and Sayers's sharply differing temperaments and racial backgrounds made them unlikely to become as close friends as they did, including becoming the first interracial roommates in the history of the National Football League, and the film chronicles the evolution of their friendship. The production was such a success on ABC that it was later shown in theaters by Columbia Pictures with a major premiere in Chicago; however, it was soon withdrawn due to a lack of business. Critics have called the movie one of the finest telefilms ever made. A 2005 readers poll taken by Entertainment Weekly ranked 'Brian's Song' seventh in its list of the top "guy-cry" films ever made.

3. Title: Brian's Song (2001 film). Fact: In the movie, Piccolo is a brash rookie with the Bears. Initially thinking Sayers is arrogant – when he is only quiet and a slight bit anti-social – they rub each other the wrong way from the moment they meet. The movie, taking place from 1965 to 1970, as the Civil Rights Movement grows, places great emphasis on integration, bringing up the conflict of when Brian and Gale room together for their first football season.

Question: Which professor from the University of Notre Dame also wrote a book which re-kindled serious philosophical debate on the existence of God?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God. Fact: The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God  is a book by Immanuel Kant, published in 1763, in the earlier period of his philosophy which he later saw as "dogmatic slumber".

2. Title: God and Other Minds. Fact: God and Other Minds is the title of a 1967 book by the American philosopher of religion Alvin Plantinga which re-kindled serious philosophical debate on the existence of God in Anglo-American philosophical circles by arguing that belief in God was like belief in other minds: although neither could be demonstrated conclusively against a determined sceptic both were fundamentally rational. Though Plantinga later modified some of his views, particularly on the soundness of the ontological argument and on the nature of epistemic rationality, he still stands by the basic theses of the book.

3. Title: Alvin Plantinga. Fact: Alvin Carl Plantinga (/ˈplæntɪŋɡə/; born November 15, 1932) is an American analytic philosopher who works primarily in logic, justification, philosophy of religion, and epistemology. From 1963 to 1982, Plantinga taught at Calvin College before accepting an appointment as the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He later returned to Calvin College to become the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy.

Question: What instrument is being held by the woman on the left in Haiku Salut?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Violin technique. Fact: It is possible to play the violin holding it in a variety of ways. Most players hold the lower bout of the instrument between the left shoulder and the jaw, often assisted by a semi-permanently attached chinrest and detachable shoulder rest. If held properly under the chin, the violinist can let go of the instrument with their hands and it will stay there firmly. Other common ways to hold the instrument include the seated Carnatic attitude, with the scroll resting on a foot, or the dancing-master's "kit" or "pochette" hold, along the forearm, by the lower margin of the rib cage, even though these are not widely traditional holds. In Morocco the violin is often held completely upright resting on the seated player's thigh with the left hand stabilizing the balance while fingering.

Question: who is the royal albert hall named after
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Royal Albert Hall. Fact: The Hall was originally supposed to have been called the Central Hall of Arts and Sciences, but the name was changed to the Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences by Queen Victoria upon laying the Hall's foundation stone in 1867, in memory of her husband consort, Prince Albert who had died six years earlier. It forms the practical part of a memorial to the Prince Consort – the decorative part is the Albert Memorial directly to the north in Kensington Gardens, now separated from the Hall by Kensington Gore.

2. Title: Memorial to the Great Exhibition. Fact: The Memorial to the Great Exhibition is an outdoor monument commemorating the Great Exhibition (1851) and depicting Albert, Prince Consort, designed by Joseph Durham with modifications by Sydney Smirke and located south of Royal Albert Hall in London, United Kingdom. Originally installed in the Royal Horticultural Society gardens in 1863, it was relocated to its current site during 1891–1893 when the gardens were reconstructed and Prince Consort Road was created.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shape Shifter (album). Fact: Shape Shifter is the twenty-first studio album (thirty-sixth album overall) by Santana. It was released on May 14, 2012. This album is the first from his new record label Starfaith Records, which is distributed by Sony Music Entertainment, owners of most of Santana's albums (except those recorded for Polydor Records which are owned by Universal Music Group). It is also the first album since 1992's Milagro that does not feature guest singers in any of the songs, a style that characterized Santana's albums since Supernatural. The album contains only one song with vocals ("Eres La Luz"). The track "Mr. Szabo" is a homage to the Hungarian guitarist Gábor Szabó, who released a series of 8 albums for Impulse Records between 1966 and 1967, and   one of Carlos Santana's early idols, and features a similar rhythmical and harmonic structure to "Gypsy Queen", a Szabó hit from 1966 covered by Santana in 1970 as a medley with Fleetwood Mac's "Black Magic Woman".

2. Title: Fleetwood Mac. Fact: Fleetwood Mac are  a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

3. Title: Voodoo Lounge. Fact: Voodoo Lounge is the 20th British and 22nd American studio album by British rock band The Rolling Stones, released in July 1994. As their first new release under their new alliance with Virgin Records, it ended a five-year gap since their last studio album, "Steel Wheels" in 1989. "Voodoo Lounge" is also the band's first album without long-time bassist Bill Wyman. He left the band in early 1991, though the Stones did not formally announce the departure until 1993. In 2009, the album was remastered and reissued by Universal Music. This album was released as a double album on vinyl and a single CD and cassette.

4. Title: UK Jive. Fact: UK Jive is the twenty-second studio album by the English rock group, the Kinks, released in 1989. It was the first album in almost three years since the 1986 album, "Think Visual". At this point, it was the longest gap between album releases since the inception of the group.

Question: is there heat transfer in an isothermal process
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Isothermal process. Fact: An isothermal process is a change of a system, in which the temperature remains constant: ΔT = 0. This typically occurs when a system is in contact with an outside thermal reservoir (heat bath), and the change will occur slowly enough to allow the system to continue to adjust to the temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange. In contrast, an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings (Q = 0). In other words, in an isothermal process, the value ΔT = 0 and therefore ΔU = 0 (only for an ideal gas) but Q ≠ 0, while in an adiabatic process, ΔT ≠ 0 but Q = 0.

2. Title: Isothermal flow. Fact: For an important practical case of a gas flow through a long tube, the model has an applicability in situations which occurs in a relatively long distance and where heat transfer is relatively rapid so that the temperature can be treated, for engineering purposes, as a constant. This model has also applicability as upper boundary to Fanno flow.

Question: What is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons, Ed, Edd n Eddy or Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Ed, Edd n Eddy. Fact: Ed, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series revolves around three preteen boys named Ed, Edd (called "Double D"), and Eddy—collectively known as "the Eds"—who live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the fictional town of Peach Creek. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.

2. Title: Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard. Fact: Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard (French: Arthur et la vengeance de Maltazard, also known in North America as Arthur and the Invisibles 2 or simply Arthur 2) is a 2009 English-language French animated/live-action feature film co-written, co-produced and directed by Luc Besson, based on his novel of the same title and starring Freddie Highmore and Mia Farrow. EuropaCorp produced the film, which is the second in Besson's Arthur series, following Arthur and the Invisibles. The film received generally negative reviews by critics. It was a success in France but, due to its predecessor's failure at the American box office, was released direct-to-video in the United States. It performed disappointingly in the rest of the world. As a result, the film and its sequel, Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds, generated huge money losses for EuropaCorp.

3. Title: Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show. Fact: Antonucci first announced a "90 minute special" in 2006, and its title in 2007. Originally set to air in 2007, its premiere date was then moved to 2008, the year it was completed in, and was finally set to release in 2009. Due to the movie, the series' sixth season was shortened, as Antonucci and the team at a.k.a. Cartoon wanted to focus on the production of the film. The score is composed by Patric Caird, who also composed the music for the series. The voice cast features all of the series' voice actors, while series voice director Terry Klassen was cast as Eddy's Brother. The film was a success in the ratings for Cartoon Network, posting double and triple digit ratings delivery gains and was met with a positive reception. It was also released on the US iTunes Store.

4. Title: Arthur (TV series). Fact: Arthur is a Canadian-American animated educational television series for children ages 4 to 8, created by Cookie Jar Group (formerly known as Cinar) and WGBH for PBS. The show is set in the fictional American city of Elwood City, and revolves around the lives of eight-year-old Arthur Read, an anthropomorphic aardvark, his friends and family, and their daily interactions with each other.

5. Title: D.N. Ace. Fact: D.N. Ace is a Canadian animated television series created by Matthew Wexler and produced by Nelvana. The show debuted on July 6, 2019 on Teletoon.

Question: is land rover the same as range rover
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Range Rover. Fact: The Land Rover Range Rover (generally known simply as a Range Rover) is a full-sized luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Land Rover, a marque of Jaguar Land Rover. The Range Rover was launched in 1970 by British Leyland. This flagship model is now in its fourth generation.

2. Title: Range Rover (L322). Fact: The Range Rover (L322) (usually known simply as the "Range Rover") is the third-generation Range Rover model from British car maker Land Rover and was originally developed under the codename 'L30'.

3. Title: Range Rover (P38A). Fact: It is usually known as the Range Rover P38 or P38A outside of Land Rover, after the office building in which the vehicle development team was based. During the early development stages, the Engineering team was based in the Engineering Block at Solihull, and the vehicle was known by the project designations of 'Pegasus' and 'Discovery,' changing to P38A when the team moved to Block 38A at Solihull. The name 'Discovery' was used temporarily as a cover to confuse journalists while the original Discovery vehicle was being developed. During production Land Rover referred to it as either the 'New Range Rover' or by its model designation of 'LP'.

4. Title: Rover Company. Fact: The Rover Company Limited was a British car manufacturing company that operated from its base in Solihull in Warwickshire. Its lasting reputation for quality and performance was such that its first postwar model reviewed by "Road & Track" in 1952 was pronounced finer than any but a Rolls-Royce. Rover also manufactured the Land Rover from 1948 onwards, which spawned the Range Rover in 1970, and went on to become its most successful and profitable product — with Land Rover eventually becoming a separate company and brand in its own right.

Question: What episode of South Park, aired on April 21, 2010, started the "Draw Mohammed Day" event? 
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Everybody Draw Mohammed Day. Fact: Everybody Draw Mohammed Day (or "Draw Mohammed Day") was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It stemmed from a protest against censorship of the American television show South Park episode "201", led by the show's distributor Comedy Central, in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing Mohammed was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010 with a message suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.

2. Title: Erection Day. Fact: "Erection Day" is the seventh episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series "South Park". The 132nd episode overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 20, 2005. In the episode, South Park Elementary's talent show is coming up and everyone expects Jimmy to win. Jimmy is elated to perform his stand-up comedy routines, but begins to suffer from unwanted erections and tries to resolve the problem.

3. Title: 201 (South Park). Fact: "201" is the sixth episode of the fourteenth season of South Park, and the 201st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode, "200", in which a group of angry celebrities demand South Park produce the Muslim prophet Muhammad. In "201", a superhero-like group of religious figures team up to save South Park from the celebrities and their monster Mecha-Streisand, while Eric Cartman learns the true identity of his father.

4. Title: Black Friday (South Park). Fact: "Black Friday" is the seventh episode in the seventeenth season of the American animated television series "South Park". The 244th episode of the series overall, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on November 13, 2013. The episode is the first of a three-episode story arc, which continues with "A Song of Ass and Fire", and concludes with "Titties and Dragons". The plot, which employs themes and motifs from the TV series "Game of Thrones", concerns the characters' anticipation of a Black Friday sale, with Randy Marsh taking a temporary job as a mall security guard to gain an advantage over the holiday shopping crowds, and the children of South Park split into two factions over whether to collectively purchase bargain-priced Xbox One or PlayStation 4 video game consoles to facilitate their online group gaming.

Question: How many novels are in the C.S. Lewis series that the Brazilian series "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo" has been compared to?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series). Fact: Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (literally translated and roughly known as "the Yellow Woodpecker Farm" or "the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch") is the title given to a series of 23 fantasy novels written by Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and as the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. Lobato's single original adult fiction, a sci-fi novel entitled O Presidente Negro ("The Black President") set in the far future, would not achieve the same popularity of Sítio. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 novel A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado, and was later republished as the first chapter of Reinações de Narizinho, which is the first novel of the actual Sítio series. The main setting is Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, where a boy, a girl and their living and thinking toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning.  On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as the Clear Waters Kingdom, and outer space. Sítio is often symbolized by the character of Emília, Lobato's most famous creation alongside Jeca Tatu.

2. Title: Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (fictional farm). Fact: The Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (literally translated and roughly known as the Yellow Woodpecker Farm or the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch) is the primary setting for the series of children's novels, "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", written by the Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato. The place is described as "a small farm with a pretty cottage, surrounded by trees" and close to several other subsettings: a stream, a virgin forest and a small village, both named the Tucanos.

Question: Michael van Gerwen had his breakthrough year in 2012 in which he defeated this defending champion.
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Michael van Gerwen. Fact: Michael van Gerwen (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmɑikəl vɑn ˈɣɛrʋən]; born 25 April 1989) is a Dutch professional darts player. He is the reigning PDC World Champion and currently ranked world number one. He began playing darts at the age of 13 and had won the World Masters and thrown a televised nine-dart finish within four years, becoming the youngest player to do either. However, after this initial burst onto the darting scene, Van Gerwen struggled for consistent form until his breakthrough year in 2012. Going from world number 38 at the start of 2012 to number four at the beginning of 2013, the year included his first major PDC title at the Grand Prix and a final at the 2013 World Championship. In 2014, at the age of 24, Van Gerwen became the youngest winner of the PDC World Championship.

2. Title: 2012 Players Championship Finals. Fact: Kevin Painter was the defending champion, but he lost to Michael van Gerwen in the first round.

3. Title: 2012 Grand Slam of Darts. Fact: The 2012 Grand Slam of Darts, also known as the William Hill Grand Slam of Darts for sponsorship purposes, was the sixth staging of the tournament, organised by the Professional Darts Corporation. The event took place from 10–18 November 2012 at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall. Phil Taylor was the defending champion, but was beaten in the Last 16 by Michael van Gerwen, who went on to make the final, but lost 16–14 to Raymond van Barneveld.

4. Title: 2012 BMW Open – Singles. Fact: Nikolay Davydenko was the defending champion, but lost in the first round to Robert Farah.

1. Title: Two turntables and a microphone. Fact: "Two turntables and a microphone" is the basic concept of a DJ's equipment. This phrase describes turntables (phonographs) and a microphone connected to a mixer. The DJ uses the mixer's crossfader to fade between two songs playing on the turntables.

Question: does mary ellen become a doctor on the waltons
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of The Waltons characters. Fact: Mary Ellen (Judy Norton Taylor) is the oldest of Liv and John's daughters, born in April 1920, aged 13 in season one. Throughout the first few seasons, she is a typically whiny, sometimes rebellious teenager, somewhat of a tomboy who enjoys playing baseball, but could also be vain, engaging in a rivalry with rich-girl Martha-Rose Coverdale for the affections of the awkward G.W. Haines (David Doremus). Mary Ellen matures into a wiser young woman and her childish fantasy of becoming a movie star gives way for a more reasonable and realistic ambition to go into medicine after reading up on it and developing an interest. She then works to gain an education as a medical worker, and becomes a nurse. However, when she ends up taking care of the people out in the country by herself, she concludes they need more medical expertise than she can offer them and continues studying medicine until she succeeds in becoming a fully-fledged doctor. Even though some people frown upon female doctors and she receives mixed support from her family, she refuses to let this stop her. Mary Ellen has a special relationship with each of her six siblings, but she is especially close to her younger sister Erin. Mary Ellen and Erin fought a lot when they were younger girls, particularly in seasons 1 and 2. But in the middle seasons, Mary Ellen and Erin matured and became friends. In season 5 after Mary Ellen married Curt, her relationship with her sister deepened even further and by the end of the show, they truly did become each other's best friend.

2. Title: Judy Norton Taylor. Fact: Judy Norton-Taylor (born January 29, 1958) is an American actress and theater director who is best known for her role as Mary Ellen Walton on "The Waltons" television series and subsequent Waltons TV movies.

Question: when did the rams come to st louis
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of the St. Louis Rams. Fact: The professional American football franchise now known as the Los Angeles Rams played in St. Louis, Missouri, as the St. Louis Rams from the 1995 through the 2015 seasons before relocating back to Los Angeles where the team played from the 1946 season to the 1994 season. The Rams franchise relocated from Los Angeles to St. Louis in 1995, which had been without a National Football League (NFL) team since the Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1988. The Rams’ first home game in St. Louis was at Busch Memorial Stadium against the New Orleans Saints on September 10, 1995, before the Trans World Dome (later the Edward Jones Dome, and now known as The Dome at America's Center) was completed for their November 12 game against the Carolina Panthers. Their last game played at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17, 2015, which they won, 31–23. The Rams’ last game as a St. Louis-based club was on January 3, 2016, against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium, where they lost in overtime 19–16.

2. Title: History of the Cleveland Rams. Fact: The professional American football team now known as the Los Angeles Rams was established in Cleveland as the Cleveland Rams, and played there from 1936 to 1945. The Rams competed in the second American Football League (AFL) for the 1936 season and the National Football League (NFL) from 1937–1945, winning the NFL championship in 1945, before moving to Los Angeles in 1946 to become the only NFL champion ever to play the following season in another city. The move of the team to Los Angeles helped to jump-start the reintegration of pro football by African-American players and opened up the West Coast to professional sports. After being based in Los Angeles for 49 years, the Rams franchise moved again after the 1994 NFL season to St. Louis. In 2016, the team moved back to Los Angeles after 21 seasons in St. Louis.

3. Title: Los Angeles Rams Cheerleaders. Fact: They were established in 1974 during the team's original tenure in Los Angeles and were known as the Embraceable Ewes. The cheerleading organization became known as the "St. Louis Rams Cheerleaders" when the team moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Beginning with the 2016 NFL season, the organization changed their name to the "Los Angeles Rams Cheerleaders" to associate themselves with the recently relocated Los Angeles Rams football team.

Question: what is the constitutional convention in new york
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: New York state Constitutional Convention of 2018. Fact: The New York state Constitutional Convention of 2018–19 is a proposed body that would revise the constitution of the State of New York, subject to the approval of the voters. Section 2 of Article XIX of the state constitution requires that every 20 years the ballot question “Shall there be a convention to revise the constitution and amend the same?” be submitted to the voters. This referendum, the 13th in almost a quarter of a millennium, will be held in November 2017. If the referendum is approved, delegates to the convention will be elected in November 2018.

2. Title: New York Constitution. Fact: New York State has held nine Constitutional Conventions: in 1776–1777, 1801, 1821, 1846, 1867–1868, 1894, 1915, 1938, and 1967; a Constitutional Commission in 1872–1873; and a Judicial Convention in 1921. Despite this, the state has had only four essentially "de novo" constitutions in its history, those of 1777 (replacing the former colonial charter), 1821, 1846, and 1894.

3. Title: Constitutional Convention (United States). Fact: The Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention the Federal Convention, or the Grand Convention at Philadelphia) took place from May 25 to September 17, 1787, in the old Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. Although the Convention was intended to revise the league of states and first system of government under the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them James Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton of New York, was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington of Virginia, former commanding general of the Continental Army in the late American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and proponent of a stronger national government, to become President of the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the Constitution of the United States, placing the Convention among the most significant events in American history.

4. Title: New York General Assembly. Fact: The New York General Assembly was first convened on October 17, 1683 during the governorship of Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick, which passed an act entitled "A Charter of Liberties" that decreed that the supreme legislative power under the Duke of York (later King James II) shall reside in a governor, council, and the people convened in general assembly; conferred upon the members of the assembly rights and privileges making them a body coequal to and independent of the British Parliament; established town, county, and general courts of justice; solemnly proclaimed the right of religious liberty; and passed acts enunciating certain constitutional liberties, e.g. taxes could be levied only by the people met in general assembly; right of suffrage; and no martial law or quartering of the soldiers without the consent of the inhabitants.

5. Title: Albany Convention. Fact: When news of the Glorious Revolution reached the Province of New York in 1689, Jacob Leisler led a rebellion in which he appointed himself ruler of the Province of New York. Albany was the only centre which resisted Leisler's claims to leadership. Under the leadership of Peter Schuyler and Robert Livingston the Albany Convention was formed which remained loyal to William and Mary. Leisler's year-long attempt to subdue the Albany Convention led to a number of military engagements.

Question: town replaced by kampala as ugandan capital in 1962
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Kampala. Fact: The city grew as the capital of the Buganda kingdom, from which several buildings survive, including the Kasubi Tombs (built in 1881), the Lubiri Palace, the Buganda Parliament and the Buganda Court of Justice. In 1890, British colonial administrator Frederick Lugard constructed a forum along Mengo Hill within the city, which allowed for the British to occupy much of the territory controlled by the Buganda, including Kampala. In 1894, the British government officially established a protectorate within this territory, and in 1896, the protectorate expanded to cover the Ankole, Toro Kingdom, and Bunyoro kingdoms as well. In 1905, the British government formally declared the entire territory to be a British colony. From that time until the independence of the country in 1962, the capital was relocated to Entebbe, although the city continued to be the primary economic and manufacturing location for Uganda. In 1922, the Makerere Technical Institute, now known as Makerere University, started as the first collegiate institution both within Kampala, and within the British colonies on the east coast of Africa. Following the 1962 independence, Milton Obote became president of Uganda, and held the position until 1971, when former sergeant Idi Amin defeated his government in a military coup. He proceeded to expel all Asian residents living within Kampala, and attacked the Jewish population living within the city. In 1978, he invaded the neighboring country of Tanzania, and in turn, the government there started the Uganda–Tanzania War, which created severe damage to the buildings of Kampala. Since then, the city has since then been rebuilt with constructions of new construction of hotels, banks, shopping malls, educational institutions, and hospitals and the improvement of war torn buildings and infrastructure. Traditionally, Kampala was a city of seven hills, but over time it has come to have a lot more.

2. Title: Battle of Kampala. Fact: The Battle of Kampala was a battle of the Ugandan Bush War that took place from 17 to 26 January 1986 in which forces of the National Resistance Army (NRA) attacked and captured the Ugandan capital, Kampala, from the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). As a result, the Ugandan government was deposed and replaced by a new one under NRA leader Yoweri Museveni.

3. Title: Fall of Kampala. Fact: The Fall of Kampala, also known as the Liberation of Kampala (Kiswahili: "Kukombolewa kwa Kampala"), was a battle during the Uganda–Tanzania War in 1979, in which the combined forces of Tanzania and the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) attacked and captured the Ugandan capital, Kampala. As a result, Ugandan President Idi Amin was deposed, his forces were scattered, and a UNLF government was installed.

Question: What category of film is Stolen Honor, a 45-minute anti-John Kerry video and Transparent, a film directed and produced by Jules Rosskam and whose title is a play on the words 'trans' and 'parent' about transgender parenting?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jules Rosskam. Fact: Jules Rosskam is an American filmmaker, artist, and educator. His films, which include "trans"parent (2005), "against a trans narrative" (2008), "Thick Relations" (2012), and "Paternal Rites" (2018), have helped shape the discussion around transgender narratives in 21st century film. Rosskam is also a noted fine artist, lecturer, and professor. He is currently assistant professor of visual arts at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

2. Title: Transparent (film). Fact: Transparent is a 2005 documentary film written, directed, and produced by Jules Rosskam. Its title is a play on the words “trans” and “parent” implying the invisibility of transgender parenting in society today. The documentary follows 19 female-to-male transsexuals from 14 different states who have given birth to, and in most cases, gone on to raise, their biological children and the challenges they face while transitioning.

3. Title: Stolen Honor. Fact: Stolen Honor is a 45-minute anti-John Kerry video documentary that was released during the September 2004 election season. It features interviews with a number of American men who contend they were prisoners of war in North Vietnam and suffered increased maltreatment while prisoners as a direct result of Kerry's Fulbright Hearing testimony in April 1971.  The subtitle of the film is Wounds That Never Heal; on the production company's website the complete title is given instead as Stolen Honor: John Kerry's Record of Betrayal. Its name was based on the book Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History by B.G. Burkett and Glenna Whitley.[citation needed]

Question: can a commercial jet break the sound barrier
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sound barrier. Fact: Although Concorde and the Tu-144 were the first aircraft to carry commercial passengers at supersonic speeds, they were not the first or only commercial airliners to break the sound barrier. On 21 August 1961, a Douglas DC-8 broke the sound barrier at Mach 1.012 or 1,240 km/h (776.2 mph) while in a controlled dive through 41,088 feet (12,510 m). The purpose of the flight was to collect data on a new leading-edge design for the wing. A China Airlines 747 may have broken the sound barrier in an unplanned descent from 41,000 ft (12,500 m) to 9,500 ft (2,900 m) after an in-flight upset on 19 February 1985. It also reached over 5g.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Madea. Fact: In Goes to Jail, Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail. She, however, began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties. Madea's brother Joe (also played by Perry) refers to her as a "po-po ho", meaning someone who is a professional at evading law enforcement.

Question: rap music and hip-hop culture have their origins in what city
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hip hop. Fact: Hip hop, or hip-hop, is a subculture and art movement developed in the Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s. The origins of the word are often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx. While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (also called rap), hip hop is characterized by nine elements, of which only four elements are considered essential to understand hip-hop musically. The main elements of hip-hop consist of four main pillars. Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: "rapping" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art. Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others. The fifth element is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion or beatboxing however it is often debated.

2. Title: Hip hop and social injustice. Fact: Hip hop music, developed in the South Bronx in the early 1970s, has long been tied to social injustice in the United States of America, particularly that of the African American experience. Hip hop artists in every decade since the genre's inception have spoken out in their lyrics against perceived social injustices such as police brutality, poverty, mass incarceration, and the war on drugs. The relationship between hip hop music and social injustice can be seen most clearly in two subgenres of hip hop, gangsta rap and conscious rap. Hip hop, specifically political hip hop, has been criticized in the past as divisive and promoting separatism due to some hip hop artists' pro-black and anti-establishment lyrical content. Musicologist Robert Walser disputes this, arguing that many white youth who are exposed to hip hop as children are more likely to have positive relationships with African Americans and resist racism from their parents or other sources out of respect for black artists they admire.

3. Title: African hip hop. Fact: Hip hop music has been popular in Africa since the early 1980s due to widespread African American influence. In 1985 hip hop reached Senegal, a French-speaking country in West Africa. Some of the first Senegalese rappers were M.C. Lida, M.C. Solaar, and Positive Black Soul.

4. Title: Brazilian hip hop. Fact: Brazilian hip hop is a national music genre. From its earliest days in the African-Brazilian communities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the genre has grown into a countrywide phenomena. Rappers, DJs, break dancers and graffiti artists are active across the complete spectrum of society blending Brazil's cultural heritage with American hip hop to form a contemporary musical fusion.

Question: what is the st louis blues ahl team
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2017–18 AHL season. Fact: Other than the Golden Knights adding a team, there were also reports of the St. Louis Blues adding an expansion team in Kansas City in November 2016. This would later be denied by the announced potential owner in Kansas City, Lamar Hunt Jr., in a press release from his ECHL team in the area, the Missouri Mavericks, and further denied by AHL commissioner, David Andrews, after the January 2017 Board of Governors meeting. In May 2017, the 30 team alignment was confirmed and there would be no expansion for 2017–18. The Golden Knights signed a multi-year affiliation with the Chicago Wolves, replacing the Blues as their primary affiliate. The Blues also announced that they would continue to send players to the Wolves for that season, as well as to the San Antonio Rampage, the AHL team that they would affiliate with for 2018–19.

2. Title: St. Louis Blues. Fact: The St. Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team based in St. Louis, Missouri. They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the six teams from the 1967 NHL expansion and is named after the W. C. Handy song "Saint Louis Blues". The Blues play their home games at the 19,150-seat Enterprise Center in downtown St. Louis, which has been their arena since moving from St. Louis Arena in 1994.

Question: when was texas annexed by the united states
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Texas annexation. Fact: The Texas Annexation was the 1845 incorporation of the Republic of Texas into the United States of America, which was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29, 1845.

2. Title: History of Texas (1845–1860). Fact: Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the Compromise of 1850, in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.

3. Title: History of Texas (1845–1860). Fact: In 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States of America, becoming the 28th U.S. state. Border disputes between the new state and Mexico, which had never recognized Texas independence and still considered the area a renegade Mexican state, led to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). When the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States.

4. Title: History of Texas (1865–99). Fact: Following the defeat of the Confederate States in the American Civil War, Texas was mandated to rejoin the United States of America. Union Army soldiers officially occupied the state starting on June 19, 1865; the date is now commemorated as the holiday Juneteenth, recognizing the official emancipation of slaves in the state. For the next nine years, Texas was governed by a series of provisional governors as the state went through Reconstruction. Texas fully rejoined the United States in 1901, with a new state constitution approved in 1903.

5. Title: Republic of Texas. Fact: The Republic of Texas  was a sovereign nation  in North America that existed from March 2, 1836, to February 19, 1846. It was bordered by Mexico to the west and southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast, the two U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast, and United States territories encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico to the north and west. The citizens of the republic were known as Texians.

Question: where do penguins live north pole or south pole
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Penguin. Fact: Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands.

Question: who committed the first act of war in the 1967 six day war conflict
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Origins of the Six-Day War. Fact: In April 1967, Syria shot at an Israeli tractor ploughing in the demilitarized zone, which escalated to a prewar aerial clash. In May 1967, following misinformation about Israeli intentions provided by the Soviet Union, Egypt expelled UN peacekeepers who had been stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since the Suez conflict, and announced a blockade of Israel's access to the Red Sea (international waters) via the Straits of Tiran, which Israel considered an act of war. Tension escalated, with both sides' armies mobilising. Less than a month later, Israel launched a surprise strike which began the Six-Day War.

2. Title: Six-Day War (2000). Fact: The Six-Day War  was a series of armed confrontations between Ugandan and Rwandan forces around the city of Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 5 to 10 June 2000. The war formed part of the wider Second Congo War (1998–2003).

3. Title: Six-Day War (1899). Fact: The Six-Day War of 1899 was fought between the British Empire and the major punti clans of the New Territories in Hong Kong on 14–19 April 1899. The British quickly and decisively ended armed resistance, but to prevent future resistance made concessions to placate the indigenous inhabitants. Despite losing to the better equipped British military, they achieved their ultimate goal which was to preserve their land rights, land use, and traditional customs. The special status and rights of the minority indigenous people of Hong Kong are extant to this day. The battle resulted in two wounded on the British side and about 500 dead on the Chinese side.

4. Title: Six-Day War (2000). Fact: Kisangani was also a scene of violence between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in August 1999 and 5 May 2000. However, the conflicts of June 2000 were the most lethal and seriously damaged a large part of the city, with more than 6,600 rounds fired.

Question: What was the year of birth of the mathematician that is credited with developing infinitesimal calculus and using Jean Picard's measurement of earth to create his theory of universal gravitation?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jean Picard. Fact: Jean-Félix Picard (21 July 1620 – 12 July 1682) was a French astronomer and priest born in La Flèche, where he studied at the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand. He died in Paris, France. He was the first person to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in a survey conducted in 1669–70, for which he is honored with a pyramid at Juvisy-sur-Orge. Guided by Maurolycus's methodology and Snellius's mathematics for doing so, Picard achieved this by measuring one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. The polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. This was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography. Picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires (developed by William Gascoigne) to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a micrometer screw on his instruments. The quadrant he used to determine the size of the Earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter-minutes. The sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. These equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to Tycho Brahe's four minutes of error. This made his measurements 24 times as accurate. Isaac Newton was to use this value in his theory of universal gravitation.

2. Title: Johann Bernoulli. Fact: Johann Bernoulli (also known as Jean or John; – 1 January 1748) was a Swiss mathematician and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family. He is known for his contributions to infinitesimal calculus and educating Leonhard Euler in the pupil's youth.

Question: is a mule a cross between a donkey and a horse
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Mule. Fact: A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes. Of the two F1 hybrids (first generation hybrids) between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny, which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion).

2. Title: Hinny. Fact: A hinny is a domestic equine hybrid that is the offspring of a male horse (a stallion) and a female donkey (a jenny). It is the reciprocal cross to the more common mule, which is the product of a male donkey, a jack, and a female horse, a mare. The hinny is distinctive from the mule both in physiology and temperament as a consequence of genomic imprinting.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. Fact: On March 6, 2017, the Raiders revealed that Bank of America would be replacing Sheldon Adelson's portion of the funding for the new stadium in Las Vegas. On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31–1 vote, ensuring them a new stadium in the process. However, even though the Raiders were approved to move to Las Vegas, the club will still play the 2017 and 2018 NFL seasons at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and still be known as the Oakland Raiders so as long as they play in the San Francisco Bay Area. About one thousand season ticket holders asked for and received refunds after the move to Las Vegas was announced. Their tickets were sold to other fans within hours, and the Raiders' 53,250 season tickets were all sold out by late May.

Question: the primary colors of pigment are cyan yellow and magenta true or false
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shades of cyan. Fact: The color cyan, a greenish-blue, has notable tints and shades. It is one of the subtractive primary colors- cyan, magenta, and yellow.

2. Title: Cyan. Fact: In the subtractive color system, or CMYK (subtractive), which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black. In the additive color system, or RGB (additive) color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light.

3. Title: Magenta. Fact: Magenta  is a color that is variously defined as purplish-red, reddish-purple or mauvish-crimson. On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, it is located midway between red and blue. It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by an inkjet printer, along with yellow, black, and cyan, to make all the other colors. The tone of magenta used in printing is called "printer's magenta".

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Games for Windows – Live. Fact: Games for Windows – Live or GFWL (trademarked as Games for Windows – LIVE) is an online gaming service used by Games for Windows–branded PC titles that enables Windows PCs to connect to Microsoft's Live service. Users, each with a unique Gamertag (the Microsoft username service for gaming that began on Xbox Live), are able to play online, keep track of their friends' status, send and receive messages, gain and keep track of Achievements and associated Gamerscore, voice chat across platforms (removed in 2010), and much more. Some games allow for cross-platform play, such as Shadowrun, putting Windows players against Xbox 360 players.

2. Title: Shadowrun (2007 video game). Fact: Shadowrun is a first-person shooter video game, developed by FASA Studio for Xbox 360 and Windows Vista. It was later cracked to work on Windows XP, confirming speculation that it was intentionally limited to Windows Vista.

3. Title: Xbox Live Indie Games. Fact: Xbox Live Indie Games (abbreviated as XBLIG, and previously called Xbox Live Community Games abbreviated as XBLCG) are video games created by individual developers or small teams of developers released on Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace for the Xbox 360. The games were developed using Microsoft XNA, and developed by one or more independent developers that are registered with App Hub. Unlike Xbox Live Arcade titles, these were generally only tested within the local creator community, had much lower costs of production, and generally were less expensive to purchase. The service was released to widespread use alongside the New Xbox Experience, and , over 3,300 games have been released on the service, many receiving media attention. All Indie Games currently require the user to be logged into their Xbox Live account to initiate the start-up of each game. Indie Games were not available in Australia, due to the requirement for all games to be rated by the Australian Classification Board, and the prohibitive expenses involved.

4. Title: Xbox Live. Fact: The service was extended in 2007 on the Windows platform, named Games for Windows – Live, which makes most aspects of the system available on Windows computers. Microsoft has announced plans to extend Live to other platforms such as handhelds and mobile phones as part of the Live Anywhere initiative. With Microsoft's mobile operating system, Windows Phone, full Xbox Live functionality is integrated into new Windows Phones that launched since late 2010. The service shut down for the original Xbox on April 15, 2010, and original Xbox Games are now only playable online through local area network (LAN) tunneling applications such as XLink Kai.

5. Title: PlayOnline. Fact: PlayOnline is an online gaming service created by Square (now Square Enix) on January 28, 2000, and has been the launcher application and Internet service for many of the online PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 games the company publishes. Games hosted included "Front Mission Online", "", "Tetra Master", and the Japanese releases of "EverQuest II", "" and "JongHoLo". As of 2018, the PC version of "Final Fantasy XI" is the only remaining game supported by the service.

Question: when did the cubs win the world series
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2016 National League Championship Series. Fact: The Cubs would go on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the World Series in seven games, after overcoming a 3–1 series deficit, winning their first World Series championship for the first time in 108 years, ending the Curse of the Billy Goat.

2. Title: 1984 National League Championship Series. Fact: The 1984 National League Championship Series was played between the San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs from October 2 to 7. San Diego won the series three games to two to advance to the World Series. The 1984 NLCS was the first postseason series ever for the Padres since the franchise's beginning in 1969, and the first appearance by the Cubs in postseason play since the 1945 World Series. The series took a disastrous turn for Chicago after a promising start, which contributed to the popular mythology of the "Curse of the Billy Goat." The series was also the last best-of-five NLCS. In 1985, the League Championship Series changed to a best-of-seven format.

3. Title: 2003 National League Championship Series. Fact: The 2003 National League Championship Series (NLCS) was a Major League Baseball playoff series played from October 7 to 15 to determine the champion of the National League, between the Central Division champion Chicago Cubs and the wild-card qualifying Florida Marlins. The Cubs, by virtue of being a division winner, had the home field advantage. The Marlins came back from a three games to one deficit and won the series in seven games, advancing to the World Series against the New York Yankees, whom they defeated in six games.

1. Title: Karl Friesen. Fact: Karl Heinz Friesen (born June 30, 1958 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a retired ice hockey goaltender. Friesen played mostly in Germany and the American Hockey League, but he also played four games in the National Hockey League with the New Jersey Devils.

Fact: Pentti Alexander Lund (December 6, 1925 – April 16, 2013) was a Finnish Canadian professional ice hockey right winger who played for the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers in the National Hockey League.

3. Title: Carl Voss. Fact: Voss was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts and he moved to Canada when he was a teenager. In 1925-26, Voss helped Queen's University's hockey team reach the Memorial Cup finals where they were defeated 2-1 by the Calgary Canadians. After a short stint with the Toronto Marlboros in the Ontario Hockey Association, Voss was signed by Conn Smythe of the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1926-27 of the National Hockey League. He played only a total of 14 games with the Leafs as he spent much of his time in the minors for five years. Voss was a leading player with Toronto's affiliate teams. He played in the Canadian Professional Hockey League with the Toronto Falcons and the London Panthers and the Buffalo Bisons of the International Hockey League. Voss led the Bisons to back to back to back championships in 1930-31 and 1931-32. Voss led the IHL in scoring in 1931-32 and was also named to the First All-Star Team.

4. Title: Johnny Gottselig.

He was the second player born in the Russian Empire to play in the NHL, as well as the first European-born head coach, and captain of a cup-winning team, in the league's history. He won two Stanley Cups in his playing career: in 1934, and 1938 (as captain). He was also with Chicago in 1961, as Director of Public Relations, when the Black Hawks won their third Stanley Cup. Gottselig was included on the team, but his name was not engraved onto the Stanley Cup.

Question: how many times did west indies won the world cup
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Cricket World Cup teams. Fact: So far, 20 teams have competed in the Cricket World Cup at least once (excluding qualifying tournaments). Of these, seven teams have taken part in every competition and only five have won. Australia are the current champions, and had won five times before (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015) The West Indies won the first two, India won two (1983 and 2011), Sri Lanka and Pakistan won one each. The West Indies and Australia are also the only nations to have won consecutive titles (West Indies: 1975 and 1979; Australia: 1999, 2003 and 2007). Australia have also notably featured in 7 finals of the total 11 World Cups, including the four in a row ( 1996 to 2007). England is the only country to have reached the final without ever winning it, having been runners-up three times. The furthest a non-Test playing nation has ever reached is the semi-finals, achieved by Kenya in the 2003 tournament.

2. Title: West Indies cricket team. Fact: The West Indies cricket team is a multi-national men's cricket team representing the Anglophone Caribbean region and administered by Cricket West Indies. The players on this composite team are selected from a chain of fifteen Caribbean territories, which are parts of several different countries and dependencies. , the West Indies cricket team is ranked eighth in the world in Tests, ninth in One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and tenth in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) in the official International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings.

3. Title: West Indies cricket team. Fact: From the mid-late 1970s to the early 1990s, the West Indies team was the strongest in the world in both Test and One Day International cricket. A number of cricketers who were considered among the best in the world have hailed from the West Indies: Sir Garfield Sobers, Lance Gibbs, George Headley, Brian Lara, Clive Lloyd, Malcolm Marshall, Alvin Kalicharan, Sir Andy Roberts, Rohan Kanhai, Sir Frank Worrell, Sir Clyde Walcott, Sir Everton Weekes, Sir Curtly Ambrose, Michael Holding, Courtney Walsh, Joel Garner, Sir Viv Richards and Sir Wes Hall have all been inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

4. Title: Cricket World Cup. Fact: The World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; the next edition in 2019 will have only ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.

Question: who did nbc send to the 2014 winter olympics
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters. Fact: In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a US$4.38 billion contract with NBC Sports, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020 (with broadcast rights to Sochi valued at US$775 million alone). As it did during the 2012 Summer Olympics (which brought strong viewership, and ultimately turned a profit of $88 million, unlike the previous Winter Olympics, which resulted in a loss of US$223 million), NBC offered live and tape-delayed coverage of events on television across its free-to-air network and a number of pay TV channels, and provided streaming of all events online and on mobile platforms to those who subscribe to the channels on participating pay television providers. ESPN and Fox Sports made competing bids for 2014 and 2016 Games only, but were outbid by NBC.

2. Title: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters. Fact: The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi will be televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, Olympic Broadcasting Services will produce the world feed provided to local broadcasters for use in their coverage. In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics were packaged together, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well, while in Australia, the 2014 Games were offered individually after all three major networks were unable to reach a deal for both.

3. Title: CBC Olympic broadcasts. Fact: The broadcasts of Summer and Winter Olympic Games produced by CBC Sports is shown on CBC Television and heard on CBC's radio networks in Canada. CBC was the broadcaster of the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Olympics.

Question: has hungary ever been in the world cup
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hungary at the FIFA World Cup. Fact: Hungary have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on nine occasions, the first being at the 1934 where they reached the quarter-final. They have been runners-up on two occasions, in 1938 and 1954. They have failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup since 1986.

2. Title: Hungary at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Fact: Hungary was in Group 4 of UEFA's World Cup qualifications. They played alongside England, Romania, Switzerland and Norway. Hungary finished as top in the group and qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

3. Title: Hungary at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Fact: Hungary was in Group 9 of UEFA's World Cup qualifications. They played alongside Soviet Union and Greece.

4. Title: Football in Hungary. Fact: The Hungarian Football Federation ( or MLSZ), the sport's national governing body, was founded in 1901. Hungary were regular features at major tournaments, such as the first Olympic Football Tournament (Stockholm 1912) and many FIFA World Cup. They were the first non-UK team to beat England at Wembley Stadium with their 6-3 victory in 1953. The golden age of Hungarian football took place in the 1950s, with the emergence of players of the caliber of Ferenc Puskás, László Kubala, Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis, Nándor Hidegkuti, Ferenc Szusza, József Bozsik & Gyula Grosics. This team (with the exception of Kubala, who only played 3 games with Hungary before playing for Spain) was known as the Golden Team and remained undefeated for 32 consecutive games, winning the gold medal in the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki and reaching the final in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, always with Ferenc Puskás as a star (84 goals in 85 matches playing for the Hungarian national football team). The twilight of this team that marveled the world came with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and after a match of the European Champion's Cup Budapest Honvéd in Bilbao, many of the stars like Czibor, Kocsis and Puskás decided not to return to their country and sign for teams from Western Europe, meaning his retirement from the national team. Puskás joined Real Madrid in 1958, winning three European Cups and debuting with the Spanish national team in 1961, while Czibor and Kocsis joined FC Barcelona. In 1967, the Ferencváros T.C. Flórián Albert became the first Hungarian to win the Golden Ball, surpassing the second place achieved by Puskás seven years before.

1. Title: Drive Me Crazy. Fact: Drive Me Crazy is a 1999 teen romantic comedy based on the novel How I Created My Perfect Prom Date by Todd Strasser. Originally entitled Next to You, the movie's title was changed to Drive Me Crazy after the song from its soundtrack, Britney Spears's song, "(You Drive Me) Crazy".

2. Title: (You Drive Me) Crazy. Fact: "(You Drive Me) Crazy" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time (1999).

It was featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 teen romantic comedy film Drive Me Crazy. "(You Drive Me) Crazy" is a pop song. The song garnered positive reviews from music critics, some of whom praised its simple formula and noted similarities to Spears' debut single, "...Baby One More Time".

Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that "Crazy for You" would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded to their liking.

4. Title: Crash (Gwen Stefani song). Fact: "Crash" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." (2004).

The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up.

Question: The Balfour Building is located at the Northeast corner of Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, it was named after Arthur J. Balfour, author of which public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Balfour Declaration. Fact: The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a  "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population. It read:

2. Title: Balfour Building. Fact: The Balfour Building is located at the Northeast corner of Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, close to the Financial and Entertainment districts, Gardiner Expressway, and the LRT. It was named after Arthur J. Balfour, author of the "Balfour Declaration" in 1917, whose goal was for the British government to support a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The high-rise was built originally for the Schiffer-Hillman Clothing Company; it was managed by numerous Jewish clothing companies in its early years. Presently, the Balfour Building is a historical tower landmark of Art Deco style in the 1930s. Elevators were installed by Otis-Fensom of Hamilton. The building has hardwood flooring, a rooftop terrace and various recently added features, including forced air heating and centrally controlled air conditioning.

3. Title: MacDonald Letter. Fact: The MacDonald Letter of 13 February 1931, also known as the Black Letter, was a letter from British prime minister Ramsay MacDonald to Chaim Weizmann, prominent Zionist leader, in response to the Passfield White Paper. The White Paper limited Jewish immigration to Palestine and Jewish purchase of Arab land. Zionist organizations worldwide mounted a vigorous campaign against the document, which culminated in MacDonald's "clarification" of the White Paper, reaffirming British support for the continuation of Jewish immigration and land purchase in Palestine. It was considered a withdrawal of the Passfield White Paper, despite the fact that Prime Minister said in parliament on 11 February 1931 that he was "very unwilling to give the letter the same status as the dominating document" i.e. the Passfield White Paper. The letter itself also claimed the importance of justice for "non-Jewish sections of the community".

They did not have another winning season until 2003, when they won the NFC Championship Game and reached Super Bowl XXXVIII, losing 32–29 to the New England Patriots. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 and 2008, the team failed to record another playoff appearance until 2013, the first of three consecutive NFC South titles.

Question: Anthony Waye is a film production executive, he worked on a number of James Bond films, including which 1981, twelfth spy film in the "James Bond" series?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Anthony Waye. Fact: Anthony Waye is a film production executive. He worked on a number of James Bond films, including For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies and the 2006 version of Casino Royale.  He is married to Patricia, the daughter of a fellow Pinewood crew-member.

2. Title: Production of the James Bond films. Fact: The James Bond film series is a series of spy films based on the fictional character of MI6 agent James Bond, "007", who originally appeared in a series of books by Ian Fleming. It is one of the longest continually-running film series in history, having been in on-going production from 1962 to the present (with a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995). In that time Eon Productions has produced 24 films, most of them at Pinewood Studios. With a combined gross of over $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the sixth-highest-grossing film series. Six actors have portrayed 007 in the Eon series, the latest being Daniel Craig.

3. Title: For Your Eyes Only (film). Fact: For Your Eyes Only (1981) is the twelfth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films.

4. Title: Outline of James Bond. Fact: James Bond is a fictional character created in 1953 by the journalist and writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short story collections. The character has also been used in the long-running and fourth most financially successful English-language film series to date (after "Harry Potter", "Star Wars", and the Marvel Cinematic Universe). The film series started in 1962 with "Dr. No"—with Sean Connery as Bond—and has continued most recently with "Spectre" (2015), starring Daniel Craig as Bond.

5. Title: Portrayal of James Bond in film. Fact: Commander James Bond RN—code number 007—is a fictional character created by the British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming in 1952. The character appeared in a series of twelve novels and two short story collections written by Fleming and a number of continuation novels and spin-off works after Fleming's death in 1964. There have been twenty-seven films in total, produced between 1962 and 2020.

Question: when do the raiders become the las vegas raiders
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. Fact: The Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas was a successful effort by the owner of the Oakland Raiders (Mark Davis) to relocate the American football club from its current and longtime home of Oakland, California to Paradise, Nevada. The team is scheduled to begin play as the Las Vegas Raiders for the 2020 National Football League (NFL) season, playing home games at the Las Vegas Stadium, although a move to Las Vegas could happen as soon as 2019 with Sam Boyd Stadium. NFL team owners voted 31–1 to approve the move, which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix, Arizona on March 27, 2017. The Raiders became the third NFL franchise to relocate in the 2010s, following the Rams' move from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles, California on January 12, 2016, and the Chargers' move from San Diego, California to Los Angeles on January 12, 2017. The Raiders' move to Las Vegas comes after years of failed efforts to renovate or replace the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, which has been rated by multiple sources as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL.

2. Title: 2017 Oakland Raiders season. Fact: The Raiders began the season on September 10 at the Tennessee Titans and finished the season December 31 at the Los Angeles Chargers. The Raiders, as they did in 2016, played one home game in Mexico City, this time against the New England Patriots. Although the league approved the Raiders' eventual relocation to Las Vegas on March 27, 2017, the team still maintained its lease at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and intended to use the stadium for at least the 2017 and 2018 seasons and the 2019 season.

Question: ACF Fiorentina returned to Serie A, following a two-year absence after the bankruptcy of the previous incarnation of the club, which Spanish retired footballer who played as a forward, were among the highly rated players to sign up for Fiorentina, either permanently or on loan?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2004–05 ACF Fiorentina season. Fact: ACF Fiorentina returned to Serie A, following a two-year absence after the bankruptcy of the previous incarnation of the club. Fiorentina returned only due to the expansion in terms of the number of top-league teams, and therefore had to significantly strengthen the squad in pre-season. Dario Dainelli, Giorgio Chiellini, Hidetoshi Nakata, Fabrizio Miccoli, Martin Jørgensen, goalkeeper Cristiano Lupatelli, Enzo Maresca, Tomáš Ujfaluši and Javier Portillo were among the highly rated players to sign up for Fiorentina, either permanently or on loan. With this squad, Fiorentina was expected to challenge for a place on the top half of the table, but slipped into the relegation battle that affected more than half of the Serie A clubs during the dramatic season. In the end, a strong finish to the season under incoming coach Dino Zoff saved La Viola from relegation, with an emotional 3–0 victory against Brescia confirming their survival.

2. Title: Javier Portillo. Fact: Javier García Portillo (born 30 March 1982 in Aranjuez, Community of Madrid) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a forward.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but moved to Chester, New Hampshire when he was seven years old to live with his grandmother after his mother died of cancer.

2. Title: Parson James. Fact: James was born Ashton Parson in North Charleston of an interracial relationship, with his father being black and his mother white.

Question: what group was not part of the new deal coalition
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: New Deal coalition. Fact: The 1932 presidential election and the 1934 Senate and House of Representatives elections brought about long-term shifts in voting behavior, and became an enduring realignment. Roosevelt set up his New Deal in 1933 and forged a coalition of labor unions, liberals, religious, ethnic and racial minorities (Catholics, Jews and Blacks), Southern whites, poor people and those on relief. The organizational heft was provided by big-city machines, which gained access to millions of relief jobs and billions of dollars in spending projects. These voting blocs together formed a majority of voters and handed the Democratic Party seven victories out of nine presidential elections (1932–1948, 1960, 1964), as well as control of both houses of Congress during all but four years between the years 1932–1980 (Republicans won small majorities in 1946 and 1952). Starting in the 1930s, the term "liberal" was used in US politics to indicate supporters of the coalition, "conservative" its opponents. The coalition was never formally organized, and the constituent members often disagreed. The coalition usually was often divided on foreign policy and racial issues but was more united to support liberal proposals in other domestic policy.

Question: The proposed autonomous region within the Philippines, originating from an independence movement to seperate the Muslim majority-Moro areas, is now called what?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Fact: The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (; "Al-ḥukm adh-dhātiyy al-'aqlīmiyy limuslimiyy mindanāu"; abbreviated as ARMM) was an autonomous region of the Philippines, located in the Mindanao island group of the Philippines, that consisted of five predominantly Muslim provinces: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. It was the only region that had its own government. The region's "de facto" seat of government was Cotabato City, although this self-governing city was outside its jurisdiction.

2. Title: Cordillera autonomy movement. Fact: The 1986 Constitution allows for the establishment of two autonomous regions in the country; Muslim Mindanao and in the Cordilleras. Two plebiscites (1990 and 1998) were conducted in the Cordillera to legalize the autonomous status of the area where majority of the voters rejected autonomy. The area is currently under the jurisdiction of the Cordillera Administrative Region.

3. Title: Autonomous regions of the Philippines. Fact: An autonomous region of the Philippines  is a first-level administrative division and it has the authority to control the region's culture and economy. It is a minority entity that has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group. The Constitution of the Philippines allows for two autonomous regions: for Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao.

4. Title: Moro National Liberation Front. Fact: In 1996, the MNLF signed a landmark peace agreement with the Philippine government that saw the creation of Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), an area composed of two mainland provinces and three island provinces in which the predominantly Muslim population enjoys a degree of self-rule. Nur Misuari was installed as the region's governor but his rule ended in violence when he led a failed rebellion against the Philippine government in November 2001, and fled to Sabah before being deported back to the Philippines by the Malaysian authorities.

Question: when can the coast guard be transferred to the navy
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: United States Coast Guard. Fact: The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II.

2. Title: History of the United States Coast Guard. Fact: The modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service, but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton lobbied Congress to authorize a small fleet of vessels to enforce tariffs (an important source of revenue for the new nation). On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 100 revenue officers. From 1790, when the Continental Navy was disbanded, to 1798, when the United States Navy was created, these "revenue cutters" were the country's only naval force.

Question: does north carolina get cold in the winter
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Climate of North Carolina. Fact: North Carolina's climate varies from the Atlantic coast in the east to the Appalachian Mountain range in the west. The mountains often act as a "shield", blocking low temperatures and storms from the Midwest from entering the Piedmont of North Carolina. Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), except in the higher elevations of the Appalachians which have a subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cfb). For most areas in the state, the temperatures in July during the daytime are approximately 90 °F (32 °C). In January the average temperatures range near 50 °F (10 °C). (However, a polar vortex or "cold blast" can significantly bring down average temperatures, seen in the winters of 2014 and 2015.)

Question: is it true that paid search marketing is completely driven by google
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Search engine marketing. Fact: In 2007, U.S. advertisers spent US $24.6 billion on search engine marketing. In Q2 2015, Google (73.7%) and the Yahoo/Bing (26.3%) partnership accounted for almost 100% of U.S. search engine spend. As of 2006, SEM was growing much faster than traditional advertising and even other channels of online marketing. Managing search campaigns is either done directly with the SEM vendor or through an SEM tool provider. It may also be self-serve or through an advertising agency. As of October 2016, Google leads the global search engine market with a market share of 89.3%. Bing comes second with a market share of 4.36%, Yahoo comes third with a market share of 3.3%, and Chinese search engine Baidu is fourth globally with a share of about 0.68%.

2. Title: Paid inclusion. Fact: Paid inclusion is a search engine marketing product where the search engine company charges fees related to inclusion of websites in their search index. The use of paid inclusion is controversial and paid inclusion's popularity has decreased over time among search engines.

Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Lex Luthor (Smallville). Fact: Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as "The Traveler" would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.

2. Title: Lionel Luthor. Fact: Lionel Luthor is a fictional character portrayed by John Glover in the television series "Smallville". The character was initially a special guest in season one, and became a series regular in season two and continued until being written out of the show in season seven. The character returned to the show in season ten again in a special guest role as a parallel universe (Earth-2) version of the character. In "Smallville", Lionel Luthor is the father of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), and founder and CEO of LuthorCorp. Lex Luthor's father was first introduced in "Superman" comics by Jerry Siegel in 1961 and has since appeared in other Superman-related media under different names. "Smallville" is the first appearance in which the character has been an intricate part of a Superman adaptation. Series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar created Lionel Luthor for "Smallville" to provide an antithesis to the parenting style of Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) and Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole). In the DC Comics, Lex Luthor's father was originally named Jules Luthor, but later was renamed Lionel Luthor some time after "Smallville". He debuted in Superman's Girlfriend, Lois Lane #23 (February, 1961) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Kurt Schaffenberger.

3. Title: Finale (Smallville). Fact: The series follows the adventures of the young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes Superman. In the series finale, Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) learns that the planet Apokolips is coming to destroy humanity, and that Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) is under the possession of Darkseid. Meanwhile, the Lionel Luthor from Earth-2 (John Glover) attempts to bring his deceased doppelgänger's son Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) back to life. Clark finally realizes his true destiny, just in time to stop Darkseid's arrival on Earth. The finale episodes feature a flashforward seven years into the future, revealing Clark's new superhero persona, "Superman".

Question: name a city that has hosted winter olympics
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2018 Winter Olympics. Fact: Pyeongchang was elected as the host city in July 2011, at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa. This was the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games, having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, but it was only the first Winter Olympics to be held in the country. It was the first of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, the following two being Tokyo 2020 (summer) and Beijing 2022 (winter). It was the third time that an East Asian country had hosted the Winter Games, after Sapporo (1972) and Nagano (1998), both of these cities in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics to be held in mainland Asia.

2. Title: List of Olympic Games host cities. Fact: In 2022, Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games. Seven cities have hosted the Olympic Games more than once: Athens (1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics), Paris (1900, 1924, and 2024 Summer Olympics), London (1908, 1948, and 2012 Summer Olympics), St. Moritz (1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics), Los Angeles (1932, 1984, and 2028 Summer Olympics), and Innsbruck (1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics). Tokyo will join this list upon hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the summer games of 1964, as well as Beijing upon hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, having previously hosted the summer games of 2008. In addition, Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics.[d] London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics. Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics, followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028. The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games, more than any other country, followed by France with five editions. Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games.

3. Title: Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Fact: A total of six bids were initially submitted for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn by 1 October 2014, citing either the high costs of hosting the Games or the lack of local support, leaving Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China as the only two remaining candidate cities. Beijing was then elected as the host city at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 31 July 2015.

Question: Anna of Cilli and her daughter Hedwig Jagiellon were 15th-century figures in which European country's royal family?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Anna of Cilli. Fact: Anna of Cilli or Anne of Celje (c. 1381 – 21 May 1416) was Queen consort of Poland (1402–1416). She was the second wife of Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), King of Poland and Supreme Duke of Lithuania (reigned 1387–1434). Their marriage was politically motivated to strengthen Jogaila's ties with the Piast dynasty and his claims to the Polish throne. Their marriage was rather distant and during fourteen years Anna bore only one daughter, Hedwig Jagiellon, who died without issue.

Question: the shawshank redemption was it a true story
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Fact: "The story is entirely told by the character Red, in a narrative he claims to have been writing from September 1975 to January 1976, with an additional chapter added in spring 1977."

2. Title: The Shawshank Redemption. Fact: Director Frank Darabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983, on the short film adaptation of The Woman in the Room, after buying the rights from King for $1; a Dollar Deal policy King used to help new directors build a resume by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the right to adapt Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a 96-page short story written by King as part of an attempt to explore new genres. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could make for a feature film, Darabont believed it was "obvious". Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. Darabont expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, a minor character in the short story who originally dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hangs himself. Tommy, who in the story trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, is instead in the screenplay murdered on the orders of warden Norton, who is himself an amalgamation of several warden characters in King's story. At the time, prison-based films were not considered reliable box-office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption.

Question: most runs scored in mlb game all time
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Run (baseball). Fact: The record for most consecutive games with at least one run scored is 18, shared by the Yankees' Red Rolfe (August 9–August 25, 1939) and the Cleveland Indians' Kenny Lofton (August 15–September 3, 2000). The record for most runs scored by a player in a single game is 7, set by Guy Hecker of the American Association's Louisville Colonels on August 15, 1886. The modern-day record of 6 is shared by fourteen players (eight of whom attained it before 1900). Of the six modern-day players to score 6 runs in a game, the first to perform the feat was Mel Ott of the New York Giants on August 4, 1934 (he repeated the accomplishment ten years later, making him the only player ever to do it twice); the most recent was Shawn Green, then of the Los Angeles Dodgers, on May 23, 2002.

2. Title: List of Major League Baseball single-game runs scored leaders. Fact: In Major League Baseball, players have scored six or more runs in one game 16 times. This record has been achieved by 15 players, the most recent being Joe Randa of the Kansas City Royals on September 9, 2004. Mel Ott is the only player to accomplish the feat twice, doing so nearly a decade apart.

Question: is devil's food cake the same as chocolate
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Devil's food cake. Fact: Devil's food cake is a moist, airy, rich chocolate layer cake. It is considered a counterpart to the white or yellow angel food cake. Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the course of the 20th century, it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil's food from the more standard chocolate cake, though it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake, making it darker. The cake is usually paired with a rich chocolate frosting.

Question: who said love means never having to say you're sorry
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Love means never having to say you're sorry. Fact: "Love means never having to say you're sorry" is a catchphrase based on a line from the Erich Segal novel Love Story and was popularized by its 1970 film adaptation starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. The line is spoken twice in the film: once in the middle of the film, by Jennifer Cavalleri (MacGraw's character), when Oliver Barrett (O'Neal) apologizes to her for his anger; and as the last line of the film, by Oliver, when his father says "I'm sorry" after learning of Jennifer's death. In the script the line is phrased slightly differently: "Love means not ever having to say you're sorry."

2. Title: Love Is.... Fact: Love Is... is a comic strip created by New Zealand cartoonist Kim Casali (née Grove) in the 1960s. The cartoons originated from a series of love notes that Grove drew for her future husband, Roberto Casali. They were published in booklets in the late 1960s before appearing in strip form in a newspaper in 1970, under the pen name "Kim". They were syndicated soon after and the strip is syndicated worldwide today by Tribune Content Agency. One of her most famous drawings, ""Love Is...being able to say you are sorry"", published on February 9, 1972, was marketed internationally for many years in print, on cards and on souvenirs. The beginning of the strip coincided closely with the 1970 film "Love Story". The film's signature line is "Love means never having to say you're sorry." At the height of their popularity in the 1970s the cartoons were earning Casali £4-5 million annually.

Question: King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare, which term designation is given to most tragedies, written by playwright William Shakespeare?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: King Lear. Fact: King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare. It depicts the gradual descent into madness of the title character, after he disposes of his kingdom giving bequests to two of his three daughters based on their flattery of him, bringing tragic consequences for all. Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain, a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king, the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures, with the title role coveted by many of the world's most accomplished actors.

2. Title: Shakespearean tragedy. Fact: Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as "histories" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the "problem play," for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars.

3. Title: William Shakespeare. Fact: William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

4. Title: Outline of William Shakespeare. Fact: The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the life and legacy of William Shakespeare. William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and actor who lived during the 17th century. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".

5. Title: Macbeth. Fact: Macbeth (; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, "Macbeth" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.

Question: Paul Robert Potts, is a British tenor, in 2007 he won the first series of ITV's "Britain's Got Talent" with his performance of which aria from the final act of Giacomo Puccini's opera "Turandot"?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Paul Potts. Fact: Paul Robert Potts (born 13 October 1970) is a British tenor. In 2007, he won the first series of ITV's Britain's Got Talent with his performance of "Nessun dorma", an aria from Puccini's opera Turandot. As a singer of operatic pop music, Potts recorded the album One Chance, which topped sales charts in thirteen countries. Prior to winning Britain's Got Talent, Potts was a manager at The Carphone Warehouse. He had served as a Bristol city councillor from 1996 until 2003, and also had performed in amateur opera from 1999 to 2003.

2. Title: Britain's Got Talent (series 1). Fact: The first series was won by opera singer Paul Potts; as of 2019, result information on other finalists has yet to be disclosed. During its broadcast, the series averaged around 8.4 million viewers. The first series faced controversy relating to the involvement of two participants who failed to disclose information that would make them ineligible for participation, alongside receiving criticism from viewers for airing footage that was considered unsuitable during one of the semi-finals.

3. Title: Nessun dorma. Fact: "Nessun dorma" (Italian: [nesˈsun ˈdɔrma]; English: "None shall sleep") is an aria from the final act of Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot and one of the best-known tenor arias in all opera. It is sung by Calaf, il principe ignoto (the unknown prince), who falls in love at first sight with the beautiful but cold Princess Turandot. However, any man who wishes to wed Turandot must first answer her three riddles; if he fails, he will be beheaded. In the aria, Calaf expresses his triumphant assurance that he will win the princess.

4. Title: List of Britain's Got Talent finalists (series 8). Fact: Collabro are a musical theatre boy band. They formed only a month prior to their audition.

Question: did oscar de la hoya fight julio cesar chavez
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Julio César Chávez II. Fact: De La Hoya and Chavez had previously fought each other over two years earlier on June 7, 1996 for Chavez's WBC super lightweight title. In a highly–anticipated matchup, De La Hoya dominated the aging champion, winning the first three rounds on all three judge's scorecards before the fight was stopped in the fourth round due to a large gash Chavez had received over his eye after a De La Hoya right hand. In spite of De La Hoya's dominating victory, Chavez remained defiant, giving De La Hoya little credit, stating that his punches had not hurt him and solely blaming the loss on his lack of vision due to the gash. Chavez demanded a rematch as a result, but an immediate rematch could not take place as De La Hoya already had a mandatory defense lined up (which would prove to be against Miguel Ángel González in January 1997) before facing Pernell Whitaker in a super fight for Whitaker's welterweight title. De La Hoya would defeat Whitaker to capture the title and then go on to successfully defend it three times before a rematch with Chavez was announced in April 1998. The bout was contingent on both De La Hoya and Chavez winning their tune–up fights against Patrick Charpentier and Ken Sigurani respectively, which both men did, officially putting their rematch on.

2. Title: Julio César Chávez vs. Oscar De La Hoya. Fact: Julio César Chávez vs. Oscar De La Hoya, billed as "Ultimate Glory", was a professional boxing match contested on June 7, 1996 for the WBC and lineal super lightweight championship.

3. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Fernando Vargas. Fact: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Fernando Vargas, billed as "Bad Blood", was a professional boxing match contested on September 14, 2002, for De La Hoya's WBC and lineal super welterweight (light–middleweight) championships, Vargas' WBA super welterweight championship, and the vacant "The Ring" light–middleweight championship.

4. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Héctor Camacho. Fact: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Hector Camacho, billed as "Opposites Attack", was a professional boxing match contested on September 13, 1997 for the WBC and lineal welterweight championships.

5. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr.. Fact: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr., billed as The World Awaits, was a light middleweight superfight that took place on May 5, 2007, at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada between six-division world champion Oscar De La Hoya (38–4, 30 KO) and undefeated four-division champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (37–0, 24 KO). At the time, the bout was the most lucrative boxing match ever, with over $130 million in generated revenue.

2. Title: Pibare Rama Rasam. Fact: Pibare Rama rasam is a classical song composed by Sadasiva Brahmendra. This song is usually rendered in raga Ahir Bhairav of Indian classical music.

3. Title: Annamacharya. Fact: Tallapaka Annamacharya (also popularly known as Annamayya) (; IAST: taḷḷapāka annamācārya) (22 May 1408 – 4 April 1503) was a 15th-century Hindu saint and the earliest known Indian musician to compose songs called "sankirtanas" in praise of the god Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu. He is the first known composer in carnatic music. The most famous composers of Carnatic music like Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa also came after him. The musical form of the keertana songs that he composed, which are still popular among Carnatic music concert artists, have strongly influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. Annamacharya is remembered for his saintly life, and is honoured as a great devotee of Vishnu by devotees and saintly singers.

4. Title: Bhadrachala Ramadasu. Fact: Kancharla Gopanna  (c. 1620 – 1680), popularly known as Bhakta Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu , was a 17th-century Indian devotee of Lord Rama and a composer of Carnatic music. He is a famous "Vaggeyakara" (classical composer) from the Telugu classical era. His contemporaries include the stalwarts of Telugu literature such as Tallapaka Annamayya, Tyagaraja, Kshetrayya, and Shyama Sastri. He lived in the village of Nelakondapalli, near the town of Bhadrachalam, in Muslim-ruled Telugu country during the 16th century and is renowned for constructing a famous temple for Lord Sri Rama at Bhadrachalam. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian classical music as "Ramadaasu Keertanalu". Even the doyen of South Indian classical music Swami Tyagaraja learned his musical compositions. He also wrote Dasarathi Shatakamu (దాశరథి శతకము) with a 'makuTamu' (మకుటము) 'Daasarathee Karunaa payonidhee' (దాశరథీ కరుణా పయోనిధీ!), a collection of nearly 108 poems dedicated to the son of Dasaratha (Lord Rama).

Question: the clause that allows the federal government to expand its powers is the
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Enumerated powers. Fact: Interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause has been controversial, especially during the early years of the republic. Strict constructionists interpret the clause to mean that Congress may make a law only if the inability to do so would cripple its ability to apply one of its enumerated powers. Loose constructionists, on the other hand, believe it is largely up to Congress and not the courts to determine what means are "necessary and proper" to executing one of its enumerated powers. It is often known as the "elastic clause" because of the great amount of leeway in interpretation it allows; depending on the interpretation, it can be "stretched" to expand the powers of Congress, or allowed to "contract", limiting Congress. In practical usage, the clause has been paired with the Commerce Clause in particular to provide the constitutional basis for a wide variety of federal laws.

2. Title: Vesting Clauses. Fact: In United States constitutional law, the Vesting Clauses are three provisions in the United States Constitution which vest the United States' legislative power in the United States Congress, the executive power in the President, and judicial power in the Federal judiciary of the United States. The Constitution thus explicitly creates a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government of the United States.

3. Title: Section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Fact: Section 91(27) is by and large the broadest of the enumerated powers allocated to the federal government. As noted by Estey J. in "Scowby v. Glendinning":

4. Title: Limited government. Fact: The Constitution of the United States presents an example of the U.S. federal government not possessing any power except what is delegated to it by the Constitution — with the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution making explicit that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved for the people and the states.

Question: Jacques-Louis was a founding member of the geological society before returning to France after what period of French history that followed the fall of Napoleon in 1814 until the July revolution of what year?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jacques Louis, Comte de Bournon. Fact: Jacques-Louis, Comte de Bournon FRS, FGS (January 21, 1751 – 24 August 1825) was a French soldier and mineralogist who came to England after the French Revolution. He gained prominence in the scientific community, being elected a fellow of the Royal Society and was a founding member of the Geological Society before returning to France after the Bourbon Restoration.

2. Title: Bourbon Restoration. Fact: The Bourbon Restoration was the period of French history following the fall of Napoleon in 1814 until the July Revolution of 1830. The brothers of executed Louis XVI of France came to power and reigned in highly conservative fashion, and exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France. They were nonetheless unable to reverse most of the changes made by the French Revolution and Napoleon.  At the Congress of Vienna they were treated respectfully, but had to give up all the territorial gains made since 1789.

3. Title: Timeline of the Napoleonic era. Fact: Napoleon Bonaparte (15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

4. Title: Napoleon. Fact: Napoléon Bonaparte (, ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.

Question: when did charles darwin publish his theory of evolution
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Charles Darwin. Fact: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book "On the Origin of Species". By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.

2. Title: Charles Darwin. Fact: Charles Robert Darwin, (; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.

3. Title: Development of Darwin's theory. Fact: Following the inception of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection in 1838, the development of Darwin's theory to explain the "mystery of mysteries" of how new species originated was his "prime hobby" in the background to his main occupation of publishing the scientific results of the "Beagle" voyage. He was settling into married life, but suffered from bouts of illness and after his first child was born the family moved to rural Down House as a family home away from the pressures of London.

Question: who took hat trick in both innings of a test match
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of Test cricket hat-tricks. Fact: A player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career. During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match. Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.

2. Title: Jimmy Matthews. Fact: Thomas James Matthews (3 April 1884 – 14 October 1943) was an Australian Test cricketer. Bowling leg breaks, he is the only player to have taken two hat tricks in the same Test match.

3. Title: Peter Petherick. Fact: Peter James Petherick (25 September 1942 – 7 June 2015) was a New Zealand cricketer who represented New Zealand in six Test cricket matches between October 1976 and March 1977 as an off-spinner. He is one of two New Zealand bowlers to achieve a hat-trick in Test matches. He is one of only three players, along with Maurice Allom and Damien Fleming, to have taken a hat-trick on Test debut.

Question: when did women earn the right to vote
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Timeline of women's suffrage. Fact: Some women in the Isle of Man (geographically part of the British Isles but not part of the United Kingdom) gained the right to vote in 1881. Though it did not achieve nationhood until 1907, the colony of New Zealand was the first self-governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in, but not to stand for, parliamentary elections in 1893, followed closely by the colony of South Australia in 1894 (which, unlike New Zealand, allowed women to stand for Parliament). In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was granted during the age of liberty between 1718 and 1772.

2. Title: Women's suffrage. Fact: The United States gave women equal voting rights in all states with the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in 1920. Canada and a few Latin American nations passed women's suffrage before World War II while the vast majority of Latin American nations established women's suffrage in the 1940s (see table in Summary below). The last Latin American country to give women the right to vote was Paraguay in 1961.

3. Title: Timeline of women's suffrage. Fact: Women's suffrage – the right of women to vote – has been achieved at various times in countries throughout the world. In many nations, women's suffrage was granted before universal suffrage, so women and men from certain classes or races were still unable to vote. Some countries granted suffrage to both sexes at the same time. This timeline lists years when women's suffrage was enacted. Some countries are listed more than once, as the right was extended to more women according to age, land ownership, etc. In many cases, the first voting took place in a subsequent year.

4. Title: Women's suffrage in states of the United States. Fact: Women's suffrage in states of the United States refers to women's right to vote in individual states of that country. Suffrage was established on a full or partial basis by various towns, counties, states and territories during the latter decades of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century. As women received the right to vote in some places, they began running for public office and gaining positions as school board members, county clerks, state legislators, judges, and, in the case of Jeannette Rankin, as a Member of Congress.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hispano-Suiza 12Y. Fact: The Hispano-Suiza 12Y was an aircraft engine produced by Hispano-Suiza for the French Air Force in the pre-WWII period. The 12Y became the primary French 1,000 hp (750 kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Dewoitine D.520. Its design was based on the earlier and somewhat smaller, 12X. A further development was under way, the 12Z, but ended due to the German occupation of France.

2. Title: Hispano-Suiza 12Z. Fact: The 12Z, designated Type 89 by the company, was the final evolution of the series of Hispano-Suiza V-12 aircraft engines. The Z model had just entered production when France fell to the Germans during World War II. A small number were produced during the war but the German occupation government would not allow full-scale production to start. After the war small numbers were built to equip new designs, but the rapid introduction of the jet engine ended further development.

3. Title: French Air Force. Fact: The French Air Force ( ; ) is the air force of the French Armed Forces. It was formed in 1909 as the "Service Aéronautique", a service arm of the French Army, then was made an independent military arm in 1934. The number of aircraft in service with the French Air Force varies depending on source, however sources from the French Ministry of Defence give a figure of 658 aircraft in 2014. The French Air Force has 225 combat aircraft in service, with the majority being 117 Dassault Mirage 2000 and 108 Dassault Rafale. As of early 2017, the French Air Force employs a total of 41,160 regular personnel. The reserve element of the air force consisted of 5,187 personnel of the Operational Reserve.

4. Title: Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard. Fact: The aircraft is an advanced development of the Étendard IVM, which it replaced. The Super Étendard first flew in October 1974 and entered French service in June 1978. French Super Étendards have served in several conflicts such as the Kosovo war, the war in Afghanistan and the military intervention in Libya.

Question: is puerto rico the 51st state of the united states
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 51st state. Fact: Voters in Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico have both voted for statehood in referendums. As statehood candidates, their admission to the Union requires congressional approval. American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands are also U.S. territories and could potentially become U.S. states someday.

2. Title: 51st state (disambiguation). Fact: "The 51st state" is a phrase that refers to areas considered candidates for addition to the 50 states already part of the United States of America.

3. Title: Outline of Hawaii. Fact: Hawaii is the newest state among the 50 states of the United States of America. It is also the southernmost state, the only tropical state, and the only state that was previously an independent monarchy. The state comprises the Hawaiian Islands (with the exception of Midway) in the North Pacific Ocean and is the only U.S. state that is not primarily located on the continent of North America.

4. Title: List of U.S. states and territories by historical population. Fact: As the United States has grown in area and population, new states have been formed out of U.S. territories or the division of existing states. The population figures provided here reflect modern state boundaries. Shaded areas of the tables indicate census years when a territory or the part of another state had not yet been admitted as a new state. As of 2019, 6 regions of the U.S. (the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) remain non-states.

Question: The libretto is an anonymous adaptation of what William Shakespeare's wedding comedy, produced by a company most notably its 2005 production of Henry Purcell?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Fairy-Queen. Fact: The Fairy-Queen (1692; Purcell catalogue number Z.629) is a masque or semi-opera by Henry Purcell; a "Restoration spectacular". The libretto is an anonymous adaptation of William Shakespeare's wedding comedy A Midsummer Night's Dream. First performed in 1692, The Fairy-Queen was composed three years before Purcell's death at the age of 35. Following his death, the score was lost and only rediscovered early in the twentieth century.

2. Title: The Comedy of Errors (musical). Fact: The Comedy of Errors is a musical with a book and lyrics by Trevor Nunn and music by Guy Woolfenden. It is based on the William Shakespeare play, "The Comedy of Errors", which had previously been adapted for the musical stage as "The Boys from Syracuse" by Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and George Abbott in 1938. The London production won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 1977.

3. Title: Armonico Consort. Fact: Armonico Consort is a British company founded in 2001 by conductor (music) and organist Christopher Monks, which specialises in producing performances of Renaissance music and Baroque music. In 2002 the company oversaw the creation of a series of academies designed to provide choral training for schoolchildren. The company’s period musicians and instrumentalists have an international reputation in the field, and its partners and collaborators have included Sir Willard White, Dame Emma Kirkby, and Dame Evelyn Glennie. Armonico Consort is known for its innovative productions, most notably its 2005 production of Henry Purcell’s The Fairy-Queen and its performances of Mozart’s Magic Flute at the Barbican Centre in London in 2007. In 2012 Armonico Consort’s opera, Too Hot To Handel, featuring the music of Baroque composer George Frideric Handel, attracted highly positive reviews from critics. Choirs from Armonico Consort’s academies will perform at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2013.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Little Western Wall. Fact: The Little Western Wall, also known as HaKotel HaKatan (or just Kotel Katan) and the Small Kotel, (Hebrew: הכותל הקטן‎), is a Jewish religious site located in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem near the Iron Gate to the Temple Mount. The wall itself dates from the Second Temple period, (516 BCE – 70 CE). It is the continuation of the larger part of the Western Wall and almost exactly faces the Holy of Holies. HaKotel HaKatan is not as well-known and not as crowded as the larger part of the Western Wall. This section of the wall is of deep spiritual significance because of its close proximity to the Holy of Holies. However, it is not the closest location to the Holy of Holies, as there is a location in the Western Wall Tunnel which directly faces the Holy of Holies.

2. Title: Holy of Holies. Fact: The Holy of Holies (Tiberian Hebrew: קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm) is a term in the Hebrew Bible which refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle where God dwelt.  The Ark is said to have contained the Ten Commandments, which were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. It is thought to be located under the Dome of the Rock.

3. Title: Western Wall. Fact: The Western Wall, Wailing Wall, or Kotel , known in Islam as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: "Ḥā’iṭ al-Burāq" حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق ), is an ancient limestone wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the "Western Wall". The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great, which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a large rectangular structure topped by a huge flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself and its auxiliary buildings. For Muslims, it is traditionally the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, al-Buraq, on his Isra and Mi'raj to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the Western border of "al-Haram al-Sharif".

4. Title: Western Wall. Fact: The Western Wall is considered holy due to its connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the holiest site in the Jewish faith lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.



Answer the following question: 'The Little Western Wall, also known as HaKotel HaKatan (or just Kotel Katan) and the Small Kotel, is a Jewish religious site located in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, it is the continuation of the larger part of the Western Wall and almost exactly faces the Holy of Holies, a term in the Hebrew Bible which refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle, where who dwelt?' Answer in one complete sentence.

Question: the former soviet union broke into separate states
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Post-Soviet states. Fact: The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the states that emerged and re-emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its breakup in 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War. The three Baltic states were the first to declare their independence, between March and May 1990, claiming continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership.

2. Title: Republics of the Soviet Union. Fact: The Republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or Union Republics  were the ethnically based proto-states of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). For most of its history, the USSR was a highly centralized state; the decentralization reforms during the era of "Perestroika" ("Restructuring") and "Glasnost" ("Openness") conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev are cited as one of the factors which led to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.

Question: who brings the ball up the court in basketball
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Basketball court. Fact: The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

2. Title: Point forward. Fact: Generally teams employ a point forward when their best playmaker is a forward rather than a guard. A point forward is typically responsible for bringing the ball up the court and being the primary facilitator on offense, but may merely direct play once a guard brings the ball up-court.

Question: is dar es salaam the capital of tanzania
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dar es Salaam. Fact: Dar es Salaam (Dar) (from Arabic: دار السلام‎ Dār as-Salām, "the house of peace"; formerly Mzizima) is the former capital as well as the most populous city in Tanzania and a regionally important economic centre. Located on the Swahili coast, the city is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.

2. Title: Demographics of Tanzania. Fact: The population distribution in Tanzania is extremely uneven. Most people live on the northern border or the eastern coast, with much of the remainder of the country being sparsely populated. Density varies from in the Katavi Region to in Dar es Salaam. Approximately 70 percent of the population is rural, although this percentage has been declining since at least 1967. Dar es Salaam is the "de facto" capital and largest city. Dodoma, located in the centre of Tanzania, is the "de jure" capital, although action to move government buildings to Dodoma has stalled.

3. Title: Mwanza. Fact: Mwanza or Rock city to the residents is a port city on the southern shore of Lake Victoria in north-western Tanzania. With a population of more than 800,000, it is Tanzania's second largest city, after Dar es Salaam. Mwanza is the capital of the surrounding Mwanza Region, and is administratively divided into two municipal districts within that Region - Ilemela and Nyamagana.

This resulted in many informers being granted safe passage and protection in England by the British government. During the conflict, the local IRA brigade executed 15 informers, six of whom were Protestants. In April 1922, after a truce had come into effect, IRA members shot dead 13 Protestants in the Dunmanway area. It was claimed they were members of the Action Group, but this is disputed.

Question: What year was the coaster located between the former 1990 Hard Rock Cafe building and dark ride attraction that features animatronics manufactured by Sally Corporation built in?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: E.T. Adventure. Fact: E.T. Adventure is a dark ride featured at Universal Studios Florida, and formerly, Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan theme parks.  The ride is based on the movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. E.T. Adventure's animatronics were manufactured by Sally Corporation.

2. Title: Extremeroller. Fact: Extremeroller was a steel stand-up roller coaster at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. It was built by Arrow Dynamics and the first stand-up roller coaster in the United States. It was built in 1976 under the name Screamroller. In 1983, Arrow designed a stand-up train for the attraction, which was subsequently renamed Extremeroller (also known as EXT). However, the original sit-down trains were reinstalled in 1984, remaining in place until the attraction was removed in 1988 and replaced by Timber Wolf that opened in 1989. In 1990, Extremeroller was relocated to Formosa WonderWorld in Taipei, Taiwan, as "Spiral" which stood until the end of 2006 when it was removed. It is not known if has been scrapped or is in storage.

3. Title: Apocalypse: The Ride. Fact: Apocalypse: The Ride, formerly known as Terminator Salvation: The Ride, is a wooden roller coaster located at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. Manufactured by Great Coasters International, the roller coaster opened to the public on May 23, 2009. It is located in the Cyclone Bay section of the amusement park on a plot of land formerly occupied by the Psyclone (1991-2007), Shockwave (1986-1988) and Sarajevo Bobsleds (1984-1986). It was the first wooden coaster to feature onboard audio, and its "Terminator" theme was short-lived following a corporate restructuring by Six Flags in 2011. The ride was retracked in 2017, and it closed temporarily during the construction of West Coast Racers.

Question:  George Alfred Maran attended Harvard University where he and his voice came to the attention of a prolific German composer whose most popular work was written in what year?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: George Maran. Fact: George Alfred Maran (July 25, 1926 – Nov 26, 2011) was an American opera, oratorio, and concert tenor.  Born near Boston, Massachusetts. Maran attended Harvard University where he and his voice came to the attention of people such as Leonard Bernstein and Paul Hindemith. He first drew international attention when he won the “Mozart-Medaille”(Mozart Medal) from the Mozarteum International Foundation in Salzburg in 1956 on Mozart’s 200th birthday. The same year, and the next forty years thereafter, he was a soloist at the Opera in Darmstadt, Germany. Even so, he continued singing all over Europe and the United States, the world premiere of A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera) with Benjamin Britten conducting as a prime example. He has sung many wide-ranging and varied genres as soloist in opera, operetta, oratorio, and on the concert stage.

2. Title: Paul Hindemith. Fact: Paul Hindemith (English:  /ˌˈhɪndəmɪt/) (16 November 1895 – 28 December 1963) was a prolific German composer, violist, violinist, teacher and conductor. Notable compositions include his song cycle Das Marienleben (1923), Der Schwanendreher for viola and orchestra (1935), and opera Mathis der Maler (1938). Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is likely the Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber, written in 1943.

Question: The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Bucks' 32nd season in the National Basketball Association, Ray Allen and who, were both selected for the 2000 NBA All-Star Game?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 1999–2000 Milwaukee Bucks season. Fact: The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Bucks' 32nd season in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Bucks acquired Danny Manning and re-acquired Dale Ellis from the Orlando Magic. With Sam Cassell playing a full season after missing most of the lockout season due to injury, the Bucks played above .500 in the first half of the season. However, they struggled in February posting a 3–9 record as Ellis was traded to the Charlotte Hornets. With less than a month to go, the Bucks playoff chances appeared bleak as they had a 32–37 record in late March. However, down the stretch, they won 10 of their final 13 games to sneak into the playoffs as the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference, finishing fifth in the Central Division with a 42–40 record. Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson were both selected for the 2000 NBA All-Star Game.

2. Title: Ray Allen. Fact: Walter Ray Allen Jr. (born July 20, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing three seasons of college basketball for Connecticut, Allen entered the NBA in 1996 and went on to play for the Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle SuperSonics, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. One of the most accurate three-point and free throw shooters in NBA history, he was a ten-time NBA All-Star, and won two NBA championships (2008, 2013) with the Celtics and Heat respectively. He also won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 2000 United States men's basketball team. Allen is the NBA's all-time leader in career three-point field goals made in both the regular and postseason. He has acted in two films, one of which was a lead role in the 1998 Spike Lee film, He Got Game.

3. Title: 2000–01 Milwaukee Bucks season. Fact: In the first round of the playoffs, led by the trio of Allen, Robinson and Sam Cassell, the Bucks defeated the Orlando Magic in four games. It was the first time the Bucks made it out of the NBA playoffs' first round since 1988–89. Then, in the semifinals, they would defeat the 6th-seeded Charlotte Hornets in seven games after trailing 3–2. However, they would lose in seven games in the conference finals to regular season MVP Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers. Following the season, Hunter was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, Scott Williams was dealt to the Denver Nuggets and Kersey retired.

4. Title: 2000 NBA All-Star Game. Fact: The Western Conference won the game with the score of 137-126 while Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan were both named MVP of the game. O'Neal took the All Star MVP trophy saying to Duncan, "you already have one of those rings (referring to the championship ring Duncan received due to him being a member of the 1998-99 Championship team with David Robinson and Gregg Popovich), so I'm taking the trophy." Allen Iverson was the leading scorer of the game with 26 points.

5. Title: 2000–01 Los Angeles Lakers season. Fact: The 2000–01 NBA season was the Lakers' 53rd season in the National Basketball Association, and 41st in the city of Los Angeles. The Lakers entered the season as the defending NBA champions, having defeated the Indiana Pacers in the 2000 NBA Finals in six games, winning their twelfth NBA championship. During the offseason, the Lakers acquired Horace Grant from the Seattle SuperSonics. Grant won three championships with the Chicago Bulls in the early 1990s. The team also signed free agent Isaiah Rider, who was released by the Atlanta Hawks the previous season due to off the court troubles. The Lakers won their final eight games finishing the regular season with a 56–26 record, and won the Pacific Division over the rival Sacramento Kings by one game. Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal were both selected for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, but O'Neal did not play due to an injury. The Lakers clinched the #2 seed in the playoffs.

Question: John Marshall was the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and served as Secretary of State under what American patriot who served as the second President of the United States?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: John Marshall. Fact: John Marshall (September 24, 1755 – July 6, 1835) was an American politician. He was the fourth Chief Justice of the United States (1801–1835). His court opinions helped lay the basis for United States constitutional law and many[who?] say he made the Supreme Court of the United States a coequal branch of government along with the legislative and executive branches. Previously, Marshall had been a leader of the Federalist Party in Virginia and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1799 to 1800. He was Secretary of State under President John Adams from 1800 to 1801 and, at the age of 45, became the last of the chief justices to be born in Colonial America.

2. Title: John Adams. Fact: John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (1797–1801) and the first Vice President (1789–97). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.

In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family.

Question: What is the publishing date of this novel by Ruth Plumly Thompson, originally written in 1959, and featuring Jinnicky the Red Jinn as a principal pre-existing character?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jinnicky the Red Jinn. Fact: The Red Jinn, later known as Jinnicky, is one of Ruth Plumly Thompson's most frequently occurring characters in her Oz books.  He was first introduced in Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz as a mysterious figure who educates Jack Pumpkinhead on the use of the Pirate Sack.  Although a detailed description is included in the text, Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz includes no illustrations of the Red Jinn aside from a gruesome color plate that did not appear outside the first edition, in which he has massive piercings.  He was reintroduced, drawn, and given the name Jinnicky in The Purple Prince of Oz; he also appeared in the follow-up, The Silver Princess in Oz.  (He makes a cameo appearance in The Wishing Horse of Oz, and he is the principal pre-existing character in Thompson's sub-canonical penultimate Oz book, Yankee in Oz).   Jack Snow apparently thought the Red Jinn was a separate character, for he considered The Purple Prince of Oz Jinnicky's first appearance in Who's Who in Oz, though he did not include a separate Red Jinn entry.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: High School USA!. Fact: High School USA! is an American animated series produced by Friends Night and Animation Domination High-Def Studios. The series was created and written by Dino Stamatopoulos (creator of Moral Orel and Mary Shelley's Frankenhole). Nick Weidenfeld, Hend Baghdady and Stamatopoulos executive produce the series. The program holds a TV-MA rating for explicit language (L) and sexual content (S), making it the first show on Fox to be given such a rating since the short-lived 1990s show Action. However, most reruns of this show are rated TV-14 for suggestive dialogue (D), sexual content (S), offensive language (L), and/or graphic violence (V).

It has been described as "Davey and Goliath... meets South Park". However, Dino Stamatopoulos, the show's creator, is wary of the comparison with Davey and Goliath, telling the New York Times that Moral Orel grew out of a concept for a send-up of a Leave It to Beaver-style 1950s sitcom that would star Iggy Pop.

3. Title: High School U.S.A.. Fact: High School U.S.A. is a 1983 American made-for-television comedy film starring Michael J. Fox, Nancy McKeon, Anthony Edwards, and Crispin Glover, directed by Rod Amateau. The film originally aired on NBC on October 16, 1983.

4. Title: Video Game High School. Fact: Video Game High School (often abbreviated VGHS) is an American action comedy web series from RocketJump Studios. It was written by Matthew Arnold, Will Campos and Brian Firenzi and directed by Matthew Arnold, Brandon Laatsch, and Freddie Wong. RocketJump Studios describes the series as "a show about best friends, first loves, and landing that perfect head shot". The team at RocketJump chose to make a web series because they "strongly believe the foundations for the future of digitally distributed content will be laid by web series".

5. Title: List of The Most Popular Girls in School episodes. Fact: "The Most Popular Girls in School" (abbreviated "MPGIS") is an American stop-motion animated comedy web series that debuted on YouTube on May 1, 2012. Created by Mark Cope and Carlo Moss, the series animates Barbie, Ken and other fashion dolls, usually with customized costumes and hairstyles, as various characters.

To date, over 80 episodes have been released. The first episode has been viewed over 8.5 million times, and many episodes have received views in the millions. After a year hiatus, the fifth season premiered June 13, 2017.

Question: Where was the album of the American band Death Grips, that later peaked at number 130 on the "Billboard" 200 chart leaked on April 14, 2012?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Money Store (album). Fact: The Money Store is the debut studio album by the group Death Grips. It was officially released on April 24, 2012, but was leaked to YouTube on April 14 and made available on vinyl on April 21 to celebrate Record Store Day. It was announced along with a second album, which would be titled No Love Deep Web. It is the follow-up to their debut mixtape Exmilitary.

2. Title: Death Grips discography. Fact: American band Death Grips has released six studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, seven singles, eight promotional singles, three remixes, and 42 music videos. The band was formed by MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy "Flatlander" Morin in Sacramento during the winter of 2010. In March 2011, they released their eponymous debut EP. The mixtape Exmilitary followed a month later and was praised by contemporary music critics. Death Grips signed a record deal with Epic Records in early 2012 and their debut studio album The Money Store was released in April to critical acclaim, peaking at number 130 on the Billboard 200 chart. Because Epic Records would not confirm a release date for their second studio album No Love Deep Web before 2013, Death Grips self-released the album in November 2012. As a result of this and the ensuing conflict between the band and the record label, Death Grips was dropped by Epic Records. No Love Deep Web received positive reviews and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.

3. Title: A Death-Grip On Yesterday. Fact: It was leaked onto P2P and BitTorrent sites on February 24, over a month before its official release. A week after its release, it had sold more than 69,000 copies and started out at #9 on the "Billboard" 200. It has gone on to sell more than 340,000 copies.

4. Title: The Terror (album). Fact: The Terror is the thirteenth studio album by experimental rock band the Flaming Lips, released on April 1, 2013 worldwide and April 16 in the U.S., on Warner Bros in the U.S. and Bella Union in the U.K. It is the last album to feature drummer Kliph Scurlock who was fired from the band a year after this album's release. It is also the first album for band member Derek Brown. Lead vocalist Wayne Coyne described the album's general idea in a press release:"We want, or wanted, to believe that without love we would disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, if we have love, give love and know love, we are truly alive and if there is no love, there would be no life. The Terror is, we know now, that even without love, life goes on... we just go on… there is no mercy killing." Experimental composer Dan Deacon remixed the album in its entirety.

He serves as a co-host of sorts and Ferguson refers to him as "my gay robot pal".

4. Title: History of nuclear weapons. Fact: Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive power from nuclear fission or combined fission and fusion reactions. Building on scientific breakthroughs made during the 1930s, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada collaborated during World War II, in what was called the Manhattan Project, to counter the suspected Nazi German atomic bomb project. In August 1945, two fission bombs were dropped on Japan, standing to date as the only use of nuclear weapons in combat. The Soviet Union started development shortly thereafter with their own atomic bomb project, and not long after that both countries developed even more powerful fusion weapons known as "hydrogen bombs".

5. Title: Nuclear weapons testing. Fact: The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. The first thermonuclear weapon technology test of an engineered device, codenamed "Ivy Mike", was tested at the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, 1952 (local date), also by the United States. The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the "Tsar Bomba" of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50–58 megatons.

Question: The Bronx Zoo is a memoir of Lyle's tenure with which American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Bronx Zoo (book). Fact: The Bronx Zoo: The Astonishing Inside Story of the 1978 World Champion New York Yankees is a nonfiction book written by former Major League Baseball pitcher Sparky Lyle and Peter Golenbock. A memoir of Lyle's tenure with the New York Yankees, the book documents the 1978 New York Yankees season, including the 1978 World Series and conflicts between players. The book was published by Crown Publishers in 1979.

2. Title: New York Yankees. Fact: The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the New York Mets of the National League. In the 1901 season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise (which had ceased operations) and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders. The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in 1913.

3. Title: The Bronx Zoo (TV series). Fact: Benjamin Harris High School is set in the impoverished, unruly inner-city Bronx. Principal Joe Danzig (Edward Asner) does his best to maintain optimism, while dealing with the lack of motivation and direction of his staff.

4. Title: Baseball Fever. Fact: The book is located primarily in Flushing, New York, although the story includes Princeton, New Jersey and other locations. It also depicts the numerous attempts of the protagonist to get his scholarly father interested in baseball, much to his dismay.

Question: major league baseball teams with the most world series wins
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: World Series. Fact: In the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series. In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals have appeared in 19 and won 11, the New York/San Francisco Giants have played in 20 and won 8, the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in 19 and won 6, and the Cincinnati Reds have appeared in 9 and won 5.

2. Title: List of World Series champions. Fact: The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the "Fall Classic", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.

3. Title: List of American League pennant winners. Fact: Each Major League Baseball (MLB) season, one American League (AL) team wins the pennant, signifying that they are the league's champion and have the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League (NL). The pennant was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each year through the 1968 season, after which the AL Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the pennant winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current AL pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2019.

4. Title: List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts. Fact: All 16 of the original Major League franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for a franchise's first championship being for the Phillies ( years, ending in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, six of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series. Further, one franchise (the Indians) has a current championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox ( years, ending in 2004), the White Sox ( years, ending in 2005), and the Cubs ( years, ending in 2016).

5. Title: List of pre-World Series baseball champions. Fact: The modern World Series, the current championship series of Major League Baseball, began in 1903, and was established as an annual event in 1905. Before the formation of the American Association (AA), there were no playoff rounds—all championships went to the team with the best record at the end of the season. In the initial season of the National League (NL) in 1876, there was controversy as to which team was the champion: the Chicago White Stockings, who had the best overall record (52–14), or the St. Louis Brown Stockings (45–19), who were the only team to have a winning record against every other franchise in the league. The teams agreed to play a five-game "Championship of the West" series, won by St. Louis, 4 games to 1. Beginning in 1884, the championship series between the National League and the American Association were promoted and referred to as the "World's Championship Series" (WCS), or "World's Series" for short; however, they are not officially recognized by Major League Baseball as part of World Series history. Though early publications, such as Ernest Lanigan's "Baseball Cyclopedia" and Turkin and Thompson's "Encyclopedia of Baseball", listed the 19th-century games on an equal basis with those of the 20th century, "Sporting News" publications about the World Series, which began in the 1920s, ignored the 19th-century games, as did most publications about the Series after 1960. Major League Baseball, in general, regards 19th-century events as a prologue to the modern era of baseball, which is defined by the emergence of the two present major leagues.

Question: name of the horse in steptoe and son
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Steptoe and Son. Fact: The series' title music, "Old Ned", won its composer Ron Grainer his second successive Ivor Novello award. The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoe's horse, Hercules. "Steptoe and Son" is the Steptoes' trading name, but as established in the first episode, the "Son" is not Harold as initially believed, but Albert. The name dates from when he and his mother—Mrs. Steptoe—worked the rounds. The first series has the pair as very rough looking and often dirty and wearing ragged clothes, but they quickly "tidied up" for later series.

Question: when did the metric system start in canada
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Metrication in Canada. Fact: Metrication in Canada began in 1970 and while Canada has converted to the metric system for many purposes, there is still significant use of non-metric units and standards in many sectors of the Canadian economy. This is mainly due to historical ties with the United Kingdom (before metrication), the traditional use of the imperial system of measurement in Canada, proximity to the United States, and to public opposition to metrication during the transition period.

2. Title: Metric Commission. Fact: The Metric Commission , formally the Preparatory Commission for the Conversion to the Metric System, was a Canadian government agency established by the federal government in 1971 to facilitate Canada's conversion to the Metric system from the imperial system of weights and measures and to educate the public on the Metric system.

3. Title: Canada (unit). Fact: In the Portuguese metric system officially adopted in August 1814, "canada" was the name given to the unit of liquid volume. This metric canada was equivalent to 1 litre.

Question: what does the white colour in the nigeria flag stand for
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flag of Nigeria. Fact: The Flag of Nigeria was designed in 1959 and first officially hoisted on 1 October 1960. The flag is a vertical 1:2 triband of green, white, green. The two green stripes represent Nigeria's natural wealth, while the white band represents peace.

2. Title: Flag of Nigeria (1914–1960). Fact: The Flag of Nigeria between 1914 and 1960 was a British blue ensign with a green Star of David surrounding a Tudor Crown (later changed to a St Edward's Crown in 1953) with the white word "Nigeria" under it on a red disc. It was adopted by the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria following the amalgamation of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate.

3. Title: Flag of Cameroon. Fact: The colour scheme uses the traditional Pan-African colours (Cameroon was the second state to adopt them). The centre stripe is thought to stand for unity: red is the colour of unity, and the star is referred to as "the star of unity". The yellow stands for the sun, and also the savannas in the northern part of the country, while the green is for the forests in the southern part of Cameroon.

Question: who sang the theme song beauty and the beast
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Beauty and the Beast (Disney song). Fact: "Beauty and the Beast" is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for the Disney animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better. Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a "tale as old as time". Lansbury's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast, while a shorted chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film, and the song's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken's film score. "Beauty and the Beast" was subsequently recorded as a pop duet by Canadian singer Celine Dion and American singer Peabo Bryson, and released as the only single from the film's soundtrack on November 25, 1991.

2. Title: Belle (Disney song). Fact: "Belle" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman for Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film "Beauty and the Beast" (1991). Originally recorded by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara and American actor Richard White, "Belle", a mid-tempo French and classical music-inspired song, incorporates both Broadway and musical theatre elements. The film's first song and opening number, "Belle" appears during "Beauty and the Beast "as a large scale operetta-style production number that introduces the film's heroine Belle, considered a book-loving nonconformist by the townspeople of the village, who has grown weary of the provincial life in which she is supposed to live, and Gaston, the film's narcissistic villain who wishes to desire her hand in marriage despite Belle's repeated rejections.

3. Title: Evermore (Beauty and the Beast song). Fact: "Evermore" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical fantasy film "Beauty and the Beast" (2017), a live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name. Originally recorded for the film by English actor Dan Stevens, who performs the song in his starring role as the titular Beast, "Evermore" was first released as a single by American singer Josh Groban on March 3, 2017. Stevens' version became available on March 10, 2017 when the film's soundtrack was released online, while Groban's cover is played during the film's closing credits.

4. Title: Gaston (song). Fact: "Gaston" is a song from the 1991 Disney animated film "Beauty and the Beast". A short reprise is performed later in the musical.

Question: did england play the 2014 fifa world cup
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group H. Fact: The group winners, England, qualified directly for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Ukraine placed among the eight best runners-up and advanced to the play-offs, where they were drawn to play home-and-away matches against France. After winning the first match by two goals, they lost the second by three and thus failed to qualify for the World Cup.

2. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup Group H. Fact: The two teams had met in two previous matches, both friendlies, most recently in 2003, won 3–1 by Belgium.

3. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup. Fact: The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organised by FIFA. It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America. Many fans and pundits alike also consider this edition of the World Cup to be one of the greatest ever held.

4. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup Group D. Fact: Group D of the 2014 FIFA World Cup consisted of Uruguay, Costa Rica, England, and Italy. This was the only group to contain more than one previous winner of the World Cup, as there were three previous winners. It was also the only group with three top 10 FIFA World Ranking teams as of October 2013 (ranking date for final draw) and at the start of the competition. Play began on 14 June and ended on 24 June 2014.

5. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup. Fact: 31 national teams advanced through qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament (with Bosnia and Herzegovina as only debutant). A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil. For the first time at a World Cup finals, match officials used goal-line technology, as well as vanishing spray for free kicks. FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered a total of 5 million people, and the country received 1 million visitors from 202 countries. Every World Cup-winning team since the first tournament in 1930 – Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Uruguay – qualified for this tournament. Spain, the title holders, were eliminated at the group stage, along with England and Italy. Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals. Host nation Brazil, who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, lost to Germany 7–1 in the semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place.

Question: Who did the New York Giants lose to in the NFC wild card game in the 83rd regular season of the National Football League?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2017 New York Giants season. Fact: The 2017 New York Giants season was the franchise's 93rd season in the National Football League, the eighth playing their home games at MetLife Stadium and the second and final under head coach Ben McAdoo. Coming fresh off an 11–5 season from one year ago, the Giants had high hopes of a Super Bowl championship and were an expected playoff contender by many critics. However, things quickly fell apart after key injuries and controversial decisions towards the team. A disastrous and unexpected 0–5 start to their season (their second in 5 years), coupled with major injuries to the team, including star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., had the Giants suffer to a franchise worst 3–13 record. By Week 10, after losing to the previously winless 49ers, the Giants were standing at 1–8, their worst record since 1980. The Giants were officially eliminated from playoff contention on November 26, 2017 when the Falcons defeated the Buccaneers 34–20, the Panthers defeated the Jets 35–27 and the Eagles defeated the Bears 31–3.

2. Title: 2018 New York Giants season. Fact: The 2018 season was the New York Giants' 94th in the National Football League, their ninth playing their home games at MetLife Stadium and their first under head coach Pat Shurmur. The Giants entered the season looking to improve on their 2017 campaign, which saw the team finish with a 3–13 record, their worst since the adoption of a 16-game regular season. Despite starting 1–7 for the second consecutive year, the Giants managed to improve on their 3–13 campaign with a 30–27 win over the Chicago Bears. After a 17–0 shutout loss to the Titans in Week 15, the Giants missed the playoffs for the second straight season. The season was highlighted by blown fourth-quarter leads much like 2015, the Giants were in 12 one-possession games and lost eight games by seven points or fewer. The Giants finished the season 5–11 and last place in the NFC East for the second straight year and the first time they finished last in back to back years since 1977 and 1978.

3. Title: 2002 New York Giants season. Fact: The 2002 New York Giants season was the team's 78th season in the National Football League. The team improved upon their previous season's 7–9 disappointment, winning ten games and returning to the playoffs for the second time in three years, ending the season on a four-game winning streak.    After a midseason slump, head coach Jim Fassel stripped offensive coordinator Sean Payton of playcalling duties, and the Giants went on to a winning streak that would carry them to the playoffs.  Leading 35–14 in the third quarter of the NFC wild card came at San Francisco, Jeremy Shockey dropped a touchdown pass forcing a field goal to make the score 38–14.  Fassel decided to rest starting running back Tiki Barber to save him for the next round, but the 49ers gained momentum, and the Giants did not score again, losing the game 39–38.  Following the season, Payton was not retained; he won the Super Bowl seven years later as the head coach of the New Orleans Saints.

4. Title: 2016 New York Giants season. Fact: The Giants began 2–0 before falling into a three-game losing streak to the Redskins, Vikings and Packers. The Giants rebounded and went on a six-game winning streak for the first time since 2010, before falling to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 13. The Giants then upset the 11–1 Dallas Cowboys in Week 14 to improve to 9–4. With their Week 14 win over the Dallas Cowboys, the Giants clinched a winning season for the first time since 2012 and also swept the Cowboys for the first time since 2011. The Giants got their 10th win of the season in Week 15, having a 10 win season for the first time since 2010. Their 7–1 record at home is their best home record since MetLife Stadium opened in 2010.

5. Title: 2016 New York Giants season. Fact: The New York Giants season was the franchise's 92nd season in the National Football League, their seventh season playing their home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and the first under head coach Ben McAdoo.

1. Title: Alcatraz Island. Fact: Alcatraz Island (/ˈælkəˌtræz/) is located in San Francisco Bay, 1.25 miles (2.01 km) offshore from San Francisco, California, United States. The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, a military prison (1868), and a federal prison from 1934 until 1963. Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco, who were part of a wave of Native activism across the nation, with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972, Alcatraz became part of a national recreation area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Malleefowl. Fact: The malleefowl ("Leipoa ocellata") is a stocky ground-dwelling Australian bird about the size of a domestic chicken (to which it is distantly related). It is notable for the large nesting mounds constructed by the males and lack of parental care after the chicks hatch. It is the only living representative of the genus "Leipoa", though the extinct giant malleefowl was a close relative.

Question: why did snape call himself the half blood prince
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Severus Snape. Fact: Before leaving Hogwarts to accompany Dumbledore in locating another horcrux –part of Voldemort's soul– Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney that it was Snape who overheard the prophecy and told it to Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself. Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. Enraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous "Half-Blood Prince" (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias Snape and pure-blood Eileen Prince). Snape passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book's end. The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape and the reason for Snape's actions remain unknown until the final book. In an interview, Rowling mentioned that at this point in the series, the Harry–Snape relationship has become "as personal, if not more so, than Harry–Voldemort."

Question: who do you play as in metal gear solid v the phantom pain
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Fact: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an action-adventure, stealth game in which players take the role of Punished "Venom" Snake from a third-person perspective in an open world environment. The gameplay elements were largely unchanged from Ground Zeroes, meaning that players will have to sneak from several points in the game world, avoiding enemy guards, and remaining undetected. Included in Snake's repertoire are binoculars, maps, a variety of weapons, explosives, and stealth-based items such as cardboard boxes and decoys. Following one of the series traditions, The Phantom Pain encourages players to progress through the game without killing, using non-lethal weapons such as tranquilizer darts to subdue enemies. Players may traverse the game world with vehicles such as jeeps and tanks, in addition to traveling on foot or on horseback, and as certain locations are mountainous, occasionally, players can opt to go rock climbing as a shortcut. They may call for helicopter support against enemy soldiers or request airstrikes that can bomb the target area or change the current weather. Snake can call on AI companions—including Quiet, a silent female sniper with supernatural abilities; D-Horse, a horse with a customizable saddle for carrying more equipment in the field; D-Walker, a manned, highly agile mobile weapons platform that can provide heavy weapons support; and D-Dog, a wolf pup raised and trained on the new Mother Base to assist him in the field. The companions' abilities and their effectiveness will depend on the player's relationship with them. There is a large emphasis based on tactics in The Phantom Pain.

Fact: It was released as a single in December 1968 and reached No. 3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 (their last Top Ten hit in US) and No. 1 in the "Cashbox" Top 100 in early 1969 (the band's third American number-one single). The single also did well elsewhere, peaking at No. 1 in the "RPM" Canadian Singles Chart and at No. 10 in the Kent Music Report in Australia. However, despite the band's commercial success the previous year, "Touch Me" did not chart in the UK Singles Chart.

4. Title: Green Door. Fact: The hit version of the song in the United States was recorded by Jim Lowe, backed by the orchestra of songwriter Davie, with Davie also playing piano, and by the vocal group the High Fives. The track was arranged by Davie, who added thumbtacks to the hammers of his piano and sped up the tape to give a honky-tonk sound. Released by Dot Records, the single reached #1 on the Billboard charts for one week on November 17, 1956, replacing "Love Me Tender" by Elvis Presley.

5. Title: Light My Fire. Fact: "Light My Fire" is a song by the Doors, which was recorded in August 1966 and released in January 1967 on their self-titled debut album. Released as an edited single on April 24, 1967, it spent three weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late July, and one week on the Cash Box Top 100, nearly a year after its recording.

Question: What album with a free digital down load of "Flash Delirium" given away on the bands official website,  marks a departure from the synthpop style that first brought the band acclaim on their debut studio album "Oracular Spectacular"?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flash Delirium. Fact: "Flash Delirium" is a song released by the American psychedelic rock band MGMT on their second album Congratulations. It was the first single to be released from the album and was originally referred to as a "taster" before the band abandoned their original plan to not release any singles from Congratulations in order to solidify its existence as a singular body of work. A free digital download of the song was given away on the band's official website. "Flash Delirium" was made available as a digital download from iTunes on March 24, 2010.

2. Title: Congratulations (album). Fact: Congratulations is the second studio album by American rock band MGMT, first self-released through MGMT's website on March 20, 2010 with a general release following on April 13, 2010 by Columbia Records. The album marks a departure from the synthpop style that first brought the band acclaim on their debut studio album Oracular Spectacular and features a more psychedelic, progressive and guitar-driven sound. MGMT began writing the tracks that would ultimately appear on Congratulations in early 2009. They eventually headed to a Malibu studio to work on the album, with producer Peter Kember (Sonic Boom), an ex-member of Spacemen 3, where vocal contributions from Royal Trux singer Jennifer Herrema were also recorded for the album. VanWyngarden has stated that the album is influenced by the band's massive rise in popularity since Oracular Spectacular's release. "It's us trying to deal with all the craziness that's been going on since our last album took off. Sometimes it just doesn't feel natural".

3. Title: Flash Fiktion. Fact: Flash Fiktion are an indie electronic band from London, United Kingdom. Their debut album was released in 2012.

4. Title: Flash Fiktion. Fact: Flash Fiktion formed in 2009 by Matt Bishop and Ollie Thomas. The group released its first single, "Leni" in the summer of 2010. The single became playlisted and featured as 'Hot Single Of The Week' on XFM Radio. Following single 'Capsules Of Sun' quickly became a favourite with major radio DJs such as Huw Stephens, Zane Lowe, Annie Mac and has earned them four weeks of consecutive plays from Nick Grimshaw and daytime plays from Edith Bowman.The band promoted their forthcoming album by UK touring with The Bravery and Young Knives, extensive EU touring and festival appearances next to Bastille and Mark Ronson. Their debut album was released in March 2012 on Split Records in the UK/EU, Vinyl Junkie in Japan and was published by Chrysalis/BMG. Album received critical acclaim from major publications: 'Vivacious,modernist,glam crackers!’ - NME, ‘Disturbing messages from a Dystopian future’ - Q Magazine, ‘Pop perfection’ - The Sunday Times, 'Riotous debut with a rare spark' - The Guardian. XFM Radio nominated the album for the Best British Debut of 2012.

Question: The Purcell Operatic Society was a company devoted to the works of which composer of Baroque-style music?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Purcell Operatic Society. Fact: The Purcell Operatic Society was a short-lived but influential London opera company devoted to the production of stage works by Henry Purcell and his contemporaries. It was founded in 1899 by the composer Martin Shaw and folded in 1902. Its stage director and production designer was Gordon Craig whose productions for the company marked the beginning of his career as a theatre practitioner. Their debut production of Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas in 1900 was one of the earliest staged performances of the work in modern times.

2. Title: Henry Purcell. Fact: Henry Purcell (/ˈpɜːrsəl/ or /pɜːrˈsɛl/; c. 10 September 1659[Note 1] – 21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.

Question: What is the name of the Taylor Swift song which was number-one single on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart and the album peaked at number five on the "Bllboard 200" ?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Taylor Swift discography. Fact: American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's career began with a record deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and the release of her eponymous debut album the following year. In the United States, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and stayed the longest on the chart during the 2000s. All of its singles—"Tim McGraw", "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn", and "Should've Said No"—charted within the top forty in the United States and were certified platinum by the RIAA. Swift followed with the release of the EPs Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection and Beautiful Eyes, which peaked at number twenty and number nine on the Billboard 200, respectively.

2. Title: List of Billboard 200 number-one albums of 2008. Fact: Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's "Fearless" is her first number-one album and had the longest run among the releases that have reached peak position in 2008, spending 11 non-consecutive weeks beginning with the issue dated November 29 and continuing into the 2009 chart year. She is the only singer to have achieved the longest-running album as a country female recording act in the "Billboard" 200 history. Swift is now ranked fifth on the list of solo female artists with the longest-running number-one album in "Billboard" history, tied with veterans Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Other albums with extended chart runs include Jack Johnson's fifth studio album, "Sleep Through the Static", and Metallica's ninth studio album, "Death Magnetic"; each spent three straight weeks on the chart. Three soundtrack albums topped the chart in 2008: "Juno", "Mamma Mia!" and "Twilight".

3. Title: Should've Said No. Fact: "Should've Said No" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song serves as the fifth and final single from her self-titled debut studio album. The song is about Swift addressing her former lover who cheated on her. It became her second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, and was a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition, "Should've Said No" has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

4. Title: List of Billboard number-one country songs of 2017. Fact: In the issue of "Billboard" dated February 25, singer Sam Hunt reached number one with the song "Body Like a Back Road", which would remain in the top spot through the issue dated October 14. In August the song broke the record for the most weeks spent at number one on the Hot Country Songs listing, surpassing the 24 weeks spent in the top spot by Florida Georgia Line's "Cruise" in 2012 and 2013. Hunt's song was finally knocked from the top of the chart in the issue dated October 21 by "What Ifs" by Kane Brown featuring Lauren Alaina. Two months later, "Meant to Be" by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line entered the Hot Country chart at number one, only the fourth time a song had debuted in the top position of the Hot Country Songs chart. The song would go on to break Hunt's record the following summer when it spent a 35th consecutive week at number one. On the Country Airplay chart, Dustin Lynch had the longest run at number one of 2017, spending four consecutive weeks at the top with "Small Town Boy". Lynch tied with Blake Shelton for the highest total number of weeks at number one on that chart, both artists spending five weeks in the top spot. Shelton took three different songs to number one, a feat also achieved by Thomas Rhett. No act achieved more than one chart-topper on the Hot Country Songs listing.

5. Title: For Her. Fact: The song peaked at No. 17 on "Billboard"s Hot Country Songs for chart dated August 5, 2017. It has since became Lane's second top 10 on the Country Airplay chart, and his first #1 on the Canada Country chart. It has sold 780,000 copies in the United States as of July 2018.

Question: HMS "Florentina", was the Spanish frigate "Santa Florentina", built in 1786 at Cartagena, Spain, she served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in which year, after the Treaty of Amiens?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: HMS Florentina (1800). Fact: HMS Florentina (or sometimes Florentia or Florentine), was the Spanish frigate Santa Florentina, built in 1786 at Cartagena, Spain. The British Royal Navy captured her on 6 April 1800 and took her into service as HMS Florentina. She served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in 1802 after the Treaty of Amiens. There the Admiralty had her laid-up in ordinary. She was sold in December.

2. Title: Treaty of Amiens. Fact: The Treaty of Amiens (French: la paix d'Amiens) temporarily ended hostilities between the French Republic and Great Britain during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was signed in the city of Amiens on 25 March 1802 (Germinal 4, year X, in the French Revolutionary calendar), by Joseph Bonaparte and the Marquess Cornwallis as a "Definitive Treaty of Peace". The consequent Peace of Amiens lasted only one year (18 May 1803) and engendered the only period of general peace in Europe between 1793 and 1814.  Under the treaty, Britain recognised the French Republic; the British parliament had dropped England's historical claim to the now-defunct French Kingdom only two years previously. Together with the Treaty of Lunéville (1801), the Treaty of Amiens marked the end of the Second Coalition, which had waged war against Revolutionary France since 1798.

3. Title: HMS Santa Dorothea (1798). Fact: HMS "Santa Dorothea" was a Royal Navy 34-gun fifth rate. This frigate had previously served in the Spanish Navy under the name "Santa Dorotea". Built in Spain in 1775, she served during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars until being captured while sailing as part of a squadron off Cartagena. Taken into British service, she spent the rest of the French Revolutionary and most of the Napoleonic Wars under the white ensign, until being broken up in 1814.

4. Title: HMS Santa Margarita (1779). Fact: HMS "Santa Margarita" was a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. She had been built for service with the Spanish Navy, but was captured after five years in service, eventually spending nearly 60 years with the British.



Answer the following question: 'HMS "Florentina", was the Spanish frigate "Santa Florentina", built in 1786 at Cartagena, Spain, she served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in which year, after the Treaty of Amiens?' Answer in one complete sentence.

Question: Which Beatles album begins with two songs that were released together as a single, including the first single A-side written by George Harrison?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Something (Beatles song). Fact: "Something" is a song by the Beatles, written by George Harrison and released on the band's 1969 album Abbey Road. It was also issued as a single coupled with another track from the album, "Come Together". "Something" was the first Harrison composition to appear as a Beatles A-side, and the only song written by him to top the US charts before the band's break-up in April 1970. The single was also one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on an LP album.

2. Title: Come Together. Fact: "Come Together" is a song by the Beatles written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. The song is the opening track on the album Abbey Road and was also released as a single coupled with "Something". The song reached the top of the charts in the United States and peaked at No. 4 in the United Kingdom.

3. Title: With the Beatles. Fact: With the Beatles is the second studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, exactly eight months after the band's debut "Please Please Me". Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon–McCartney and "Don't Bother Me", George Harrison's first recorded solo composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six covers (mostly of Motown, rock and roll, and R&B hits). The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.

4. Title: List of songs recorded by the Beatles. Fact: Following their signing with EMI in 1962, each member of the "Fab Four" contributed to songwriting. Their primary songwriters were the partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who composed most of the group's songs; lead guitarist George Harrison wrote 22 songs, including "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun", while drummer Ringo Starr wrote two songs ("Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden"), and was credited as co-writer for four others. While songs written by Lennon or McCartney were always credited to "Lennon–McCartney", the pair wrote many songs completely separately. These include "Come Together", "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Nowhere Man" (Lennon) and "Hey Jude", "Let It Be" and "Yesterday" (McCartney), the last of which is one of the most covered songs of all time. Artists the band covered while together included Chuck Berry ("Roll Over Beethoven", "Rock and Roll Music"), Carl Perkins ("Matchbox", "Honey Don't"), Larry Williams ("Slow Down", "Dizzy, Miss Lizzy") and Little Richard ("Long Tall Sally"). Cover songs were included on five of the band's core albums: "Please Please Me", "With the Beatles" (both 1963), "Beatles for Sale" (1964), "Help!" (1965) and "Let It Be" (1970). Lead vocals were also shared by the group, with Starr usually contributing vocals to one song per album. The group were known for their harmonies, mostly two-part, but sang intricate three-part harmonies on "This Boy", "Yes It Is" and "Because".

5. Title: 1 (Beatles album). Fact: 1 is a compilation album by the English rock band the Beatles, originally released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom and United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on only one CD. "1" was a commercial success and topped the charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies.

Question: Dracula II: Ascension is a 2003 direct-to-video American-Romanian horror film, it stars which American actor and martial artist, and is best known for his role as Mowgli in Disney's 1994 live-action adaptation of "The Jungle Book"?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jason Scott Lee. Fact: Jason Scott Lee (Chinese: 李截; pinyin: Lī Jié, born November 19, 1966) is an American actor and martial artist. Lee is perhaps best known for his roles as Bruce Lee (no relation) in the 1993 martial arts film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, and Mowgli in Disney's 1994 live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book.

2. Title: Dracula II: Ascension. Fact: Dracula II: Ascension is a 2003 direct-to-video American-Romanian horror film, directed by Patrick Lussier. It stars Jason Scott Lee, Stephen Billington and Diane Neal. Filmed entirely in Romania by Castel Film Studios, the film is the sequel to Dracula 2000. It was released direct-to-video on June 7, 2003. The film marks one of the very few cinematic portrayals of certain aspects of vampire lore, such as a vampire's compulsive need to count mustard seeds and untie knots.

3. Title: Dracula Untold. Fact: Dracula Untold is a 2014 American dark fantasy action-horror film directed by Gary Shore in his feature film debut and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. A reboot of the "Dracula" film series, the plot creates an origin story for the titular character, rather than using the story-line of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. In this adaptation, Dracula is the monster alter ego, of historical figure Vlad III "the Impaler" Drăculea. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance cast in supporting roles.

4. Title: Vlad (film). Fact: Vlad is a 2003 American horror film directed by Michael D. Sellers and starring Francesco Quinn and Billy Zane. It is based on the life of Vlad Dracula, the Wallachian ruler. The film received generally bad reviews.

Question: are there any professional sports teams in nevada
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sports in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Fact: The Las Vegas metropolitan area is home to many sports, most of which take place in the unincorporated communities around Las Vegas rather than in the city itself. The Las Vegas Valley has two major league professional teams: the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL) who began play in 2017 as the region's first major pro team and the Las Vegas Aces of the WNBA. The Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) will begin play in Las Vegas as the Las Vegas Raiders by 2020 and become the region's third major professional team. Las Vegas is also home to two minor league sports teams: the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (Minor League Baseball) and the Las Vegas Lights FC of the United Soccer League, the league at the second level of the U.S. men's soccer league system. Both teams are currently the only teams to actually play in the city of Las Vegas, playing at the city-owned Cashman Field.

2. Title: Nevada Sports Network. Fact: As a sports-broadcasting group, Nevada Sports Network acquires the rights for live collegiate and pro teams to be broadcast on the Las Vegas Sports Network stations: KWWN (ESPN Radio), KENO (ESPN Deportes Radio), KRLV (Fox Sports Radio 98.9 FM and 1340 AM), and KBAD (NBC Sports Radio), making them one of the largest rights holders for collegiate athletics nationwide.

Question: what was the first music video on vh1
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: MTV Classic (American TV channel). Fact: VH1 Smooth launched on August 1, 1998 as a part of the "Suite" digital package, delaying the original launch date of July 31, 1998. The channel focused on smooth jazz, new age, and adult contemporary music. The first music video to play on the channel was a cover of "Makin' Whoopee" by Branford Marsalis.

2. Title: List of first music videos aired on MTV. Fact: This is a list of the first music videos broadcast on MTV's first day, August 1, 1981. MTV's first day on the air was rebroadcast on VH1 Classic in 2006 and again in 2011 (the latter celebrating the channel's 30th anniversary). The first hour on the air was broadcast again on August 1, 2016 and was called MTV Hour One, as part of VH1 Classic's planned re-launch as MTV Classic, MTV itself, and additionally streamed on the channel's Facebook page.

3. Title: Michael Jackson videography. Fact: In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular culture and the first African American entertainer to have a strong crossover fanbase on MTV. The popularity of his music videos that aired on MTV,  such as "Billie Jean", "Beat It" and "Thriller"—credited for transforming the music video from a promotional tool and into an art form—helped bring the relatively new channel to fame; MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R&B from channel's original 'rock 'n' roll only' format.
