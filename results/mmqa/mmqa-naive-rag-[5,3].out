The competition is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of at Churchill Downs. Colts and geldings carry and fillies .

2. Title: Derby (horse race). Fact: A derby ( , ) is a type of horse race named after the Derby Stakes run at Epsom Downs Racecourse in England. That was in turn named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, who inaugurated the race in 1780. Perhaps the best-known example after the original is the Kentucky Derby in the United States.

3. Title: 2018 Kentucky Derby. Fact: The race was broadcast by NBC, with coverage by NBCSN of undercard races beginning at 12:30pm EDT and main network coverage of pre-race activities starting at 2:30pm EDT. Post time was 6:52pm EDT. The race was won by Justify, who was the post-time favorite, in a time of 2:04.20 over a sloppy track. It is the first time since 1882 that the race was won by a horse that did not race at the age of two.

4. Title: Kentucky Derby. Fact: It is dubbed "The Run for the Roses," stemming from the blanket of roses draped over the winner.

Colts and geldings carry a weight of ; fillies carry . The race, nicknamed The Test of the Champion, and The Run for the Carnations, is the third and final leg of the Triple Crown and is held five weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes.

Question: when was last time dodgers played yankees in the world series
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dodgers–Yankees rivalry. Fact: The Dodgers–Yankees rivalry is a Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Dodgers are a member club of the National League (NL) West division, and the Yankees are a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The rivalry between the Dodgers and Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues. The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States. The Dodgers currently lead the regular season series 7-6. Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings, the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981. They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a 3-game interleague series. Nevertheless, games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds.

2. Title: 1956 World Series. Fact: The 1956 World Series of Major League Baseball was played between the New York Yankees (representing the American League) and the defending champion Brooklyn Dodgers (representing the National League) during October 1956. The Series was a rematch of the 1955 World Series. It was the last all-New York City Series until 44 years later in 2000; the Dodgers and the New York Giants moved to California after the 1957 season. Additionally, it was the last time a New York team represented the National League until 1969 when the New York Mets defeated the Baltimore Orioles in five games.

3. Title: 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season. Fact: The 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 127th for the franchise in Major League Baseball, and their 59th season in Los Angeles, California. They began the season with a new manager in Dave Roberts. The Dodgers in 2016 set a new Major League record for the most players placed on the disabled list in one season. On September 25, they clinched their fourth consecutive National League West division championship, the first team in the division ever to do so and defeated the Washington Nationals in five games in the Division Series. They were defeated by the Chicago Cubs; the eventual World Series champion, in six games in the National League Championship Series. This was the 67th and final season for Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully.

4. Title: New York Yankees. Fact: The team is owned by Yankee Global Enterprises, an LLC that is controlled by the family of the late George Steinbrenner, who purchased the team in 1973. Brian Cashman is the team's general manager, and Aaron Boone is the team's field manager. The team's home games were played at the original Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 to 2008. In 1974 and 1975, the Yankees shared Shea Stadium with the Mets, in addition to the New York Jets and the New York Giants. In 2009, they moved into a new ballpark of the same name that was constructed adjacent to the previous facility, which was closed and demolished. The team is perennially among the leaders in MLB attendance.

5. Title: 2017 American League Championship Series. Fact: The 2017 American League Championship Series was a best-of-seven playoff pitting the Houston Astros against the New York Yankees for the American League pennant and the right to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 World Series. The Astros defeated the Yankees in seven games after falling behind three games to two. The home team won every game in the series.

Question: What singer replaced Diana Ross as the lead singer of The Supremes in January of 1970 and provided the lead vocals on the song "You Gotta Have Love in Your Heart" by the Supremes and the Four Tops?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: You Gotta Have Love in Your Heart. Fact: “You Gotta Have Love in Your Heart” is a duet single between Motown singing groups The Supremes and the Four Tops, released as a single from their The Return of the Magnificent 7 album in 1971. The single became a modest charter peaking at #55 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and #41 on the U.S. Billboard R&B Singles Chart. The single fared better in the UK, where it reached #25 in the official top 50 single chart. Lead vocals were by the groups' respective lead singers Jean Terrell and Levi Stubbs.

2. Title: Jean Terrell. Fact: Jean Terrell (born Velma Jean Terrell, November 26, 1944 in Belzoni, Mississippi) is an American R&B and jazz singer. She replaced Diana Ross as the lead singer of The Supremes in January 1970.

3. Title: Love Child (The Supremes album). Fact: Several different producers and production teams worked on the "Love Child" LP. Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, the production team behind the Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell hit singles, wrote and produced the album's first single, "Some Things You Never Get Used To". The single peaked at number 30 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, the Supremes' weakest chart showing since 1963. Wanting to improve the group's waning sales, Motown CEO Berry Gordy assembled a team (Frank Wilson, Pam Sawyer, Deke Richards, Henry Cosby, R. Dean Taylor, and Gordy himself) to create a hit single for The Supremes. The result was "Love Child", which returned the Supremes to the Billboard Hot 100's number-one position.

Question: caesar's son name in planet of the apes
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of Planet of the Apes characters. Fact: After 10 years of living in peace and safety, Caesar still reigns strongly over the apes. Now middle-aged and raising a teenage son, Caesar leads his apes on a hunting expedition. He attempts to teach his son, Blue Eyes how to hunt without getting hurt but this doesn't go to plan. Blue Eyes, who continuously ignores his father's orders, wanders off and is attacked by a bear. Caesar, seeing his son in trouble rushes to help him but he too struggles with the bear. He calls for his friend Koba who spears the bear in the back, between the shoulder blades, killing it. Caesar emerges from under the bear's corpse and attempts to check Blue Eyes' injuries only to be brushed off.

2. Title: Tarzan of the Apes. Fact: John and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Viscount and Lady Greystoke from England, are marooned in the western coastal jungles of equatorial Africa in 1888. Some time later, their son John Clayton II is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape Kerchak. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape Kala.

3. Title: Asterix and Son. Fact: A baby boy mysteriously appears on Asterix's doorstep one morning. Stung by speculation that he could be the father, Asterix sets out with Obelix to find the baby's parents. Their only clue is the embroidered linen of the baby's clothes and wrappings, suggesting he comes from a rich Roman family. The Romans attempt to kidnap the baby, at the behest of Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's adopted son. Getafix realizes that the baby was left in the village for its protection.

4. Title: Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle. Fact: In this story, this is a revisionist version in which Lord Greystoke grows up in England, while Kal-El is raised by the apes as "Argozan", although the two switch roles at the conclusion with Greystoke remaining in the jungle while Kal-El returns to the city, Greystoke stating in a letter to his parents that he feels as though he has found his true place.

5. Title: Tarzan Finds a Son!. Fact: A plane flying to Cape Town, carrying a young couple and their baby, crashes in the jungle. Everyone on the plane dies, except for the baby who is rescued by Cheeta, Tarzan's chimpanzee. Tarzan and Jane adopt the child and name him "Boy." Five years later, a search party comes looking for Boy, because he is the heir to the Greystoke family fortune worth millions. The search party is led by the Lancing family, who are distant cousins of Greystoke. Tarzan and Jane claim the child is dead and that Boy is theirs, but the elder Lancing, Sir Thomas, recognizes Boy's eyes. The younger Lancings suggest leaving Boy and taking the inheritance. When Sir Thomas objects, they say they will take him back and, as legal guardians, still control the inheritance. Sir Thomas says he'll tell Tarzan, but the rest of the party imprison Sir Thomas in a tent and plan to abduct Boy. Tarzan overhears them plotting; he steals their guns and throws them into a deep lake. Jane arrives the next day and learns what has taken place, and admits that Boy is Greystoke. She persuades Tarzan to retrieve the cache of guns, without which the search party can't survive. Tarzan retrieves them but Jane drops the rope so that Tarzan is trapped.

Question: What object is in front of Felicia Day's face?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dorothy (Chase). Fact: The image's subject is Chase's 11-year-old daughter, Dorothy, wearing a white dress with full-length sleeves, a straw hat with a green bow, a black belt, black tights, and black shoes. She is standing against a brown background without any detail, so the viewer's eye is focused only on her. Dorothy stares straight out at the viewer, engaging them. With a 6' canvas, "Dorothy" is reminiscent of full-length Baroque paintings of emperors, giving the young girl a grandiose image.

2. Title: Pandemonia. Fact: Pandemonia is a character and persona created as conceptual art by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009. Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses, Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of "Vice" as "Roy Lichtenstein's blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft Jeff Koons inflatable". She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.

3. Title: Miss Masque. Fact: Miss Masque is the secret identity of Diana Adams, a young socialite who decides to fight crime and injustice in disguise. Miss Masque has no super powers, but relies on her wit and a pair of pistols. Her original costume was a mini-skirted red dress with red hat, gloves and cape, and a domino mask; yellow double "M" emblems on her chest and hat completed the ensemble. A later version of the costume had a bare midriff and shorter sleeves.

4. Title: Sunlight (Benson). Fact: Sunlight is created in the American impressionist style. It is a portrait of a woman, who has been identified as Benson's daughter, Eleanor, standing on a hill, looking out towards the Atlantic Ocean off Penobscot Bay in Maine. She is in a white dress that is getting ruffled by the wind blowing off the ocean. Her left hand is up, shielding her face from the sun, while her right hand is planted on her hip, a pose Benson used multiple times. Because of the woman shielding her eyes form the sun, it is likely that the sunlight is the actual subject of the painting.

5. Title: Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach. Fact: The painting is dominated by a depiction of brown-skinned pears with the eponymous footed silver fruit bowl, which somewhat resembles a wine glass (specifically a coupe). A deliberately created optical illusion of the eponymous human face (a face which would reappear in one of Dalí's later works, "The Endless Enigma") occupies the same space as the dish; the fruits suggest wavy hair, the dish's bowl becomes the forehead, the stem of the dish serves as the bridge of the nose, and the dish's foot doubles as the chin. The eyes of the large face, however, are formed by "background" objects lying on the sand at the edge of the strand — deeper in the image — rather than sharing form with the fruit dish. The face's right eye is what appears to be a shell, and the face's left eye a piece of a ship or boat.

Question: when did the first episode of phineas and ferb come out
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Phineas and Ferb. Fact: Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy ("Agent P") for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

2. Title: Phineas and Ferb (soundtrack). Fact: Phineas and Ferb is the first soundtrack album for the Disney Channel television series, "Phineas and Ferb", which was released September 22, 2009 in the United States on compact disc by Walt Disney Records. The album contains 26 songs from season one. It also contains the bonus track "The F-Games" that can only be heard online.

3. Title: Take Two with Phineas and Ferb. Fact: Take Two with Phineas and Ferb is a spin-off series from "Phineas and Ferb" that premiered on Disney Channel on December 3, 2010. The series revolves around Phineas and Ferb interviewing celebrities, a premise which bears similarities to that of Cartoon Network's late-night animated talk show "Space Ghost Coast to Coast" on Adult Swim. The show only has one season.

4. Title: Huckleberry Hound Meets Wee Willie. Fact: Huckleberry Hound Meets Wee Willie is the very first pilot episode of the Huckleberry Hound cartoon series, debuting in the premiere segment of "The Huckleberry Hound Show" on October 2, 1958. It was produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, while the story was crafted by Charles Shows and Dan Gordon.

5. Title: The Simpsons (season 1). Fact: The series was originally set to debut in autumn 1989 with the episode "Some Enchanted Evening", which was meant to introduce the main characters; during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling 70% of the episode needed to be redone.

Question: is make your own kind of music on an album
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Make Your Own Kind of Music (song). Fact: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" is a pop song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, first recorded in 1968 by the New York City-based trio the Will-O-Bees (Janet Blossom, Steven Porter, and Robert Merchanthouse), who regularly performed Mann/Weil compositions. After Cass Elliot had a hit in the summer of 1969 with Mann/Weil's "It's Getting Better", she recorded "Make Your Own Kind of Music" as the follow-up single, and her album Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama was re-released as "Make Your Own Kind Of Music/It's Getting Better," the title cut having been added to the original track listing. However, Elliot's "Make Your Own Kind of Music" single only reached No. 36. The similar chart impact of the follow-up single, another Mann/Weil composition entitled "New World Coming," which reached No. 42, signaled Elliot's challenges in maintaining a profile as a current hitmaker, as the 1960s turned into the 1970s. The Cass Elliot track is in the key of E major.

2. Title: Make Your Own Kind of Music (TV series). Fact: The key concept of the series was that each show starts off with the letter "A". The first show started off with "A is for Alpert", as Herb Alpert stood next to a big letter "A", and introduced the show. The cast would then go down the alphabet list, and when they got to "Z", the show would end.

3. Title: Album musical. Fact: An album musical is a type of recording that sounds like an original cast album but is created specifically for the recording medium and is complete entertainment product in itself, rather than just promoting or reflecting an existing or planned musical theatre production or revue. Although there has been no one term consistently used to describe this type of recording, the genre predates the use of the term "concept album" by several decades, dating back to the era of 78-rpm records with such original works as Gordon Jenkins' "Manhattan Tower" (1946, expanded in 1956) and "The Letter" (1959) starring Judy Garland, and Stan Freberg's "Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years" (1961). On most contemporary concept albums, the performers or bands sing as themselves, whereas on an album musical the performers are playing characters in a story.

4. Title: Making Music So You Don't Have To. Fact: "Hot Press" described the album as "a ticklish, impulsive body of work, but its happy, functional marriage of strings, piano and guitars hints that the band have played nice, taken their hyperactivity medication and developed the album into a gratifyingly mature, ambitious and reflective work".

5. Title: Create/Control. Fact: Create/Control is a record label for artists who have the ability to create their own recordings without label funding who will then use the label for distribution, promotion and marketing.

Question: who owned the manor in the middle ages
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Manor house. Fact: A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.

2. Title: Lord of the manor. Fact: Lord of the manor is a title given to a person holding the lordship of a manor in the Anglo-Saxon system of manorialism which emanated from feudalism in English and Irish history. In modern England and Wales, it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined, and may be held in moieties:

3. Title: List of manor houses. Fact: A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor in Europe.

The proper unit of tenure under the feudal system is the fee (or fief), on which the manor became established through the process of time, akin to the modern establishment of a "business" upon a freehold site. The manor is nevertheless often described as the basic feudal unit of tenure and is historically connected with the territorial divisions of the march, county, hundred, parish and township.

Question: what are flying monkeys in wizard of oz called
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Winged monkeys. Fact: Winged monkeys (often referred to in adaptations and popular culture as flying monkeys) are fictional characters created by American author L. Frank Baum in his classic children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). The winged monkeys are exactly what the name implies: jungle monkeys with powerful bird-like feathered wings attached to their shoulders which allow them to fly. They are most notable from the famous 1939 musical movie by MGM. Ever since, they have taken their own place in popular culture, regularly referenced in comedic or ironic situations as a source of evil or fear.

2. Title: Winged serpent (Dungeons & Dragons). Fact: In the "Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, the winged serpent, also known as a flying snake is a magical beast. As their name suggests, they resemble small snakes who sport large, gauzy, feathered wings, and hence have the ability to fly. They also have small crests on their heads, and a stingray-like fan on the end of their tails. They live in jungles.

3. Title: Goofus bird. Fact: The Goofus bird is a mythical, backwards-flying bird, originating in lumberjack folklore in North America. It is also known variously as the "Filla-ma-loo bird" or the "Flu-fly bird".

4. Title: Flying mouse. Fact: The flying mice, also known as the pygmy scaly-tails, pygmy scaly-tailed flying squirrels, or pygmy anomalures are not true mice, not true squirrels, and are not capable of true flight. These unusual rodents are essentially miniaturized versions of anomalures and are part of the same sub-Saharan African radiation of gliding mammal.

5. Title: Sugar glider. Fact: The sugar glider ("Petaurus breviceps") is a small, omnivorous, arboreal, and nocturnal gliding possum belonging to the marsupial infraclass. The common name refers to its preference for sugary foods such as sap and nectar and its ability to glide through the air, much like a flying squirrel. They have very similar habits and appearance to the flying squirrel, despite not being closely related—an example of convergent evolution. The scientific name, "Petaurus breviceps", translates from Latin as "short-headed rope-dancer", a reference to their canopy acrobatics.

Question: Danish Viking, who ruled over parts of Friesland between 841 and 873 was the uncle of a Viking leader who raided the British Isles, West Francia, Frisia, and Lotharingia in the 860s and 870?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rodulf Haraldsson. Fact: Rodulf Haraldsson (died June 873), sometimes Rudolf, from Old Norse Hróðulfr, was a Viking leader who raided the British Isles, West Francia, Frisia, and Lotharingia in the 860s and 870s. He was a son of Harald the Younger and thus a nephew of Rorik of Dorestad, and a relative of both Harald Klak and Godfrid Haraldsson, but he was "the black sheep of the family". He was baptised, but under what circumstances is unknown. His career is obscure, but similar accounts are found in the three major series of Reichsannalen from the period: the Annales Bertiniani from West Francia, the Annales Fuldenses from East Francia, and the Annales Xantenses from Middle Francia. He died in an unsuccessful attempt to impose a danegeld on the locals of the Ostergo.

2. Title: Rorik of Dorestad. Fact: Rorik (Roricus, Rorichus; Old Norse Hrørek, c. 810 – c. 880) was a Danish Viking, who ruled over parts of Friesland between 841 and 873, conquering Dorestad and Utrecht in 850. Rorik swore allegiance to Louis the German in 873. He died at some point between 873 and 882.

3. Title: Halfdan Ragnarsson. Fact: Halfdan Ragnarsson (; or "Healfdene"; ; died 877) was a Viking leader and a commander of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England, starting in 865.

4. Title: Ragnar Lodbrok. Fact: Ragnar Lodbrok or Lothbrok (, "Ragnar shaggy breeches", contemporary Norse: "Ragnar Loðbrók") according to legends and sagas is a Norse Viking king. He is known from Viking Age Old Norse poetry, sagas, as well as contemporary chronicles. His life and personage are historically dubious. According to traditional literature, Ragnar distinguished himself by many raids against Eastern Europe, Francia, Ireland, and Britain during the 9th century. His legendary kingdom is said to have included parts of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.

5. Title: Eohric of East Anglia. Fact: Eohric (died 902) was a Danish Viking king of East Anglia. The name "Eohric" is the Old English form of the Old Norse "Eiríkr". Little is known of Eohric or of the kingdom of East Anglia in his time. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" recorded that an army from East Anglia raided Mercia and Wessex, and a West Saxon army raided East Anglia in retaliation. The Vikings met a section of the West Saxons at the Battle of the Holme on 13 December 902, and Eohric was killed.

Question: when did the viking age finish in europe
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Viking Age. Fact: The Viking Age (793–1066 AD) is a period in European history, especially Northern European and Scandinavian history, following the Germanic Iron Age. It is the period of history when Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonization, and conquest. In this period, the Norsemen settled in Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, and present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Normandy, Scotland, England, Ireland, Isle of Man, the Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey.

2. Title: Age of the Sturlungs. Fact: This period is marked by the conflicts of powerful chieftains, "goðar", who amassed followers and fought wars, and is named for the Sturlungs, the most powerful family clan in Iceland at the time. At the end of the era, the Icelandic Commonwealth ceased to exist and Iceland became a part of Norway.

3. Title: Iron Age Scandinavia. Fact: The 6th and 5th centuries BC were a tipping point for exports and imports on the European continent. The ever-increasing conflicts and wars between the central European Celtic tribes and the Mediterranean cultures destabilized

4. Title: High Middle Ages. Fact: The High Middle Ages, or High Medieval Period, was the period of European history that commenced around 1000 and lasted until around 1300. The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 (by historiographical convention).

5. Title: Scandinavian prehistory. Fact: The Scandinavian Peninsula became ice-free around the end of the last ice age. The Nordic Stone Age begins at that time, with the Upper Paleolithic Ahrensburg culture, giving way to the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers by the 7th millennium BC (Maglemosian culture c. 7500–6000 BC, Kongemose culture c. 6000–5200 BC, Ertebølle culture c. 5300–3950 BC). The Neolithic stage is marked by the Funnelbeaker culture (4000–2700 BC), followed by the Pitted Ware culture (3200–2300 BC).

Question: who played mr doolittle in my fair lady
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Stanley Holloway. Fact: Stanley Augustus Holloway, OBE (1 October 1890 – 30 January 1982) was an English stage and film actor, humourist, singer, poet and monologist. He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen, especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in "My Fair Lady". He was also renowned for his comic monologues and songs, which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.

2. Title: Wilfrid Hyde-White. Fact: Wilfrid Hyde-White (12 May 1903 – 6 May 1991) was a British character actor of stage, film and television, who achieved international recognition in his later years for his role as Colonel Pickering in the 1964 film version of the musical "My Fair Lady".

3. Title: My Fair Lady (film). Fact: Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle (Stanley Holloway), a dustman, shows up three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. Eliza goes through many forms of speech training, such as speaking with marbles in her mouth, enduring Higgins' harsh approach to teaching and his treatment of her personally. She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally "gets it"; she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent.

4. Title: Robert Coote. Fact: Robert Coote (4 February 1909 – 26 November 1982) was an English actor. He played aristocrats or British military types in many films, and created the role of Colonel Hugh Pickering in the long-running original Broadway production of "My Fair Lady".

The original Broadway and London shows starred Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.

Question: who owns the rights to little shop of horrors
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Little Shop of Horrors (musical). Fact: The musical premiered Off-Off-Broadway in 1982 before moving to the Orpheum Theatre Off-Broadway, where it had a five-year run. It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent Broadway production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with community theatre, school and other amateur groups. The musical was also made into a 1986 film of the same name, directed by Frank Oz.

2. Title: Little Shop of Horrors (film). Fact: Little Shop of Horrors was the first DVD to be recalled for content. In 1998, Warner Bros. released a special edition DVD that contained approximately 23 minutes of unfinished footage from Oz's original ending, although it was in black and white and was missing some sound, visual and special effects.[citation needed] Producer and rights owner David Geffen was not aware of this release until it made it to the stores. Geffen said, "They put out a black-and-white, un-scored, un-dubbed video copy of the original ending that looked like shit." As a result, the studio removed it from shelves in a matter of days and replaced it with a second edition that did not contain the extra material. Geffen wanted to theatrically re-release the film with the original ending intact. Geffen also claimed to have a color copy of the original ending, while the studio had lower quality, black and white duplicates as their own color print was destroyed in a studio fire years earlier. But Geffen had not known, until after the DVD was pulled, that the studio did not know there was a colored copy of the original ending in existence.

3. Title: The Little Shop of Horrors. Fact: The film stars Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, and Dick Miller, all of whom had worked for Corman on previous films. Produced under the title "The Passionate People Eater", the film employs an original style of humor, combining black comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof. "The Little Shop of Horrors" was shot on a budget of $28,000 (about $240,000 in 2019), with interiors being shot in two days utilizing sets that had been left standing from "A Bucket of Blood".

4. Title: Little Box of Horrors. Fact: Little Box of Horrors is a box set released by North Carolina horror punk band Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 on May 9, 2006, on Restless Records in the USA and People Like You Records in Europe on May 29, 2006. However, the Europe version feature different artwork, and comes with an exclusive keychain, poster, and 26-page booklet, in a limited edition of 2666 and the first time "The Late, Late, Late Show" was reissued by People Like You.

5. Title: The Little Shop of Horrors. Fact: The Little Shop of Horrors is a 1960 American comedy film directed by Roger Corman. Written by Charles B. Griffith, the film is a farce about an inadequate florist's assistant who cultivates a plant that feeds on human blood. The film's concept is thought to be based on a 1932 story called "Green Thoughts", by John Collier, about a man-eating plant. However, Dennis McDougal suggests that Griffith may have been influenced by Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi short story from 1956, "The Reluctant Orchid" (which was in turn inspired by the 1905 H. G. Wells story "The Flowering of the Strange Orchid").

Question: What type of ball is shown on the sleeve of Arjen Robben?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Leeuwenhosen. Fact: Leeuwenhosen (singular "leeuwenhose") are orange-colored, lion-tailed overalls distributed by the Bavaria Brewery, a popular Dutch beer brewery, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The concept was realized by Peer Swinkels, the chairman of Bavaria. The leeuwenhosen may have been inspired by the coincidence that the Dutch team's icon is a lion, as is the 2006 FIFA World Cup mascot Goleo VI. The word "leeuwenhosen" is a mix of the Dutch word for "lions" and the German word for "trousers", in the same style as the German article of clothing called lederhosen, meaning "leather trousers".

2. Title: Arntor. Fact: The cover art was originally a propaganda poster from Nazi Germany, although the band is not considered National Socialist Black Metal.

3. Title: Dirkon. Fact: The Dirkon is a paper camera kit that was first published in 1979 in the Communist Czechoslovakian magazine ABC mladých techniků a přírodovědců [translated as An ABC of Young Technicians and Natural Scientists]. The pattern was created by Martin Pilný, Mirek Kolár, and Richard Vyškovský.

4. Title: Tropentarn. Fact: "Tropentarn's" official name is "3 Farben-Tarndruck der Bundeswehr" (3-color camouflage print of the Bundeswehr) – Instead of the 5-color scheme of greens, brown, and black of temperate Flecktarn, "Tropentarn" uses only three colors: a base color of 70% khaki tan with 20% medium brown and 10% dark green spots.

5. Title: Einstürzende Neubauten logo. Fact: The Einstürzende Neubauten logo is an appropriation by the band of an archaic ideogram or petroglyph. It appears to be a stick figure with a circled dot or sol  as its head. Its oldest source may be Stonehenge, or the ancient Chinesebronze inscriptions for i-Ching #52.

Question: Is there an adult on the motorcycle in the poster for Easy Wheels?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Easyriders. Fact: In addition to its coverage of motorcycles (particularly Harley-Davidsons) and related activities, "Easyriders" is also known for including pictures of nude or topless women and paintings by David Mann who was a California graphic artist whose paintings celebrated biker culture.

2. Title: Wheelie bike. Fact: A wheelie bike, also called a muscle bike, high-riser, spyder bike or banana bike, is a type of stylized children's bicycle designed in the 1960s to resemble a chopper motorcycle and characterized by ape hanger handlebars, a banana seat with sissy bar, and small  wheels. Notable examples include the Schwinn Sting-Ray and Krate lines and the Raleigh Chopper line. Other notable manufacturers and retailers that offered models include AMF, CCM, Columbia, Huffy, Iverson, J. C. Penney, Malvern Star, Monark, Murray, Ross, Sears, and Vindec.

3. Title: Stationary Bike. Fact: The story opens with Richard Sifkitz, a commercial artist and widower, visiting his doctor and staring at the results of his physical. Richard's cholesterol is dangerously high, largely due to his constant intake of fast food. The doctor tells him an interesting anecdote in relation to the number. He likens Richard's metabolism to a team of workmen who clear away the various junk foods that Richard ingests. As Richard ages, these metabolic workmen tire out and begin to slow down, resulting in heart trouble. This metaphor strikes Richard and he ultimately becomes somewhat obsessed with the idea.

4. Title: Riding in Cars with Boys. Fact: In 1961, eleven-year-old Beverly "Bev" Donofrio rides with her father, Connecticut police officer Leonard, to the Christmas tree lot. When she reveals that she wants a bra for Christmas in order to get the attention of a boy she likes, Leonard tells her she is too young to be thinking about boys, and to focus on books.

5. Title: The Bike Song. Fact: The music video was directed by Warren Fu and shot in a South London park. It features Kyle Falconer and Spank Rock as well as a cameo by Ronson's wife, actress and musician Joséphine de La Baume, actress Felicity Jones and Rose Elinor Dougall (who is currently in Mark Ronson's touring band).

Question: who is considered by many to be the father of soul
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Passions of the Soul. Fact: Notable precursors to Descartes who articulated their own theories of the passions include St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and Thomas Hobbes.

2. Title: Ancient Egyptian conception of the soul. Fact: According to ancient Egyptian creation myths, the god Atum created the world out of chaos, utilizing his own magic (ḥkꜣ). Because the earth was created with magic, Egyptians believed that the world was imbued with magic and so was every living thing upon it. When humans were created, that magic took the form of the soul, an eternal force which resided in and with every human being. The concept of the soul and the parts which encompass it has varied from the Old Kingdom to the New Kingdom, at times changing from one dynasty to another, from five parts to more. Most ancient Egyptian funerary texts reference numerous parts of the soul: the "ẖt" (Middle Egyptian /ˈçuːwaʔ/, Coptic ϩⲏ) "physical body", the "sꜥḥ" "spiritual body", the "rn" (/ɾin/, Coptic ⲣⲁⲛ or ⲗⲉⲛ) "name, identity", the "bꜣ" "personality", the "kꜣ" (/kuʔ/, Old Egyptian /kuʀ/) "double", the "jb" (/jib/, Coptic ⲉⲡ) "heart", the "šwt" "shadow", the "sḫm" (/saːχam/) "power, form", and the "ꜣḫ" (the combined spirits of a dead person that has successfully completed its transition to the afterlife). Rosalie David, an Egyptologist at the University of Manchester, explains the many facets of the soul as follows:

3. Title: Soul music. Fact: Little Richard (who inspired Otis Redding) and James Brown were equally influential. Brown was known as the "Godfather of Soul" and Richard proclaimed himself the "king of rockin' and rollin', rhythm and blues soulin'", because his music embodied elements of all three, and because he inspired artists in all three genres.

4. Title: Cerinthus. Fact: Cerinthus (; fl. c. 50-100 AD) was an early gnostic Christian, who was prominent as a heresiarch in the view of the early Church Fathers. Contrary to the Church Fathers, he used the Gospel of Cerinthus, and denied that the Supreme God made the physical world. In Cerinthus' interpretation, the Christ descended upon Jesus at baptism and guided him in ministry and the performing of miracles, but left him at the crucifixion. Similarly to the Ebionites, he maintained that Jesus was not born of a virgin, but was a mere man, the biological son of Mary and Joseph.

5. Title: Plato's theory of soul. Fact: The parts are located in different regions of the body:

Question: Is Glen E. Friedman's jacket zipped or unzipped?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Thriller jacket. Fact: The red jacket worn by Michael Jackson in the "Michael Jackson's Thriller" video in 1983 has been referred to as the "Thriller" jacket. Designed by Deborah Nadoolman Landis, the candy-apple-red jacket, with black strips, was noted for its many zips, its "M" logo and Star Trek-esque angular, rigid shoulder design. The jacket became the "hottest outerwear fad of the mid-1980s" and was widely emulated. Because counterfeit copies of the jacket could sell at over $500, in 1984 Jackson filed a lawsuit in New York City to prevent unauthorized copies of the jacket and his other merchandise. On June 27, 2011, the jacket sold for $1.8 million at Julien's Auctions. The buyer, Milton Verret, described the jacket as "the greatest piece of rock and roll memorabilia in history". The proceeds from the jacket were donated to the Shambala Animal Kingdom, where Jackson's Bengal tigers were housed when he left Neverland Ranch in 2006.

2. Title: Eisenhower jacket. Fact: The Eisenhower jacket, or "Ike" jacket, is a type of waist length jacket or blouson developed for the U.S. Army during the later stages of World War II and named after Dwight D. Eisenhower. Intended to be worn on its own or as an insulating layer beneath the M-43 Field Jacket, it featured a pleated back, adjustable waist band, fly-front buttons, bellows chest pockets, slash side pockets, and shoulder straps.

3. Title: Blouson. Fact: A blouson or blouse jacket is a jacket that is drawn tight at the waist, causing it to blouse out and hang over the waistband. Some of them have a hood. It takes most of its modern traits from the American flight jacket and police blouson. It is related to the Eisenhower jacket. It is considered to be both sportswear and casual civilian clothing.

4. Title: The Jacket (Seinfeld). Fact: "The Jacket" is the third episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom "Seinfeld" and the show's eighth episode overall. In the episode, protagonist Jerry Seinfeld buys an expensive suede jacket and has dinner with the father of his ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. Elaine's father Alton (Lawrence Tierney), a war veteran and writer, makes Jerry and his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander) very uncomfortable. Elaine is delayed and Jerry and George are stuck with Alton waiting for her at the hotel.

5. Title: Schott NYC. Fact: Schott NYC (Schott Bros) is an American clothing manufacturing company located in New York City. The company was founded in 1913 by brothers Irving and Jack Schott. Schott NYC was the first company to put a zipper on a jacket and they created the classic Perfecto motorcycle jacket, which was made popular by films such as "The Wild One" (1953). The company made clothing for the United States Armed Forces during World War II and later also for American law enforcement. Schott NYC is still owned by the Schott family and still manufacture much of their clothing in the United States.

Question: What position are James Brown's hands in?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: John Mason Brown. Fact: Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he graduated from Harvard College in 1923. He worked for the "New York Evening Post" from 1929 to 1941. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War II, beginning in 1942. His book, "To All Hands", documents his activities aboard the "USS Ancon" (AGC-4) during Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily.

2. Title: Right Hand Man (Hamilton song). Fact: The song Right Hand Man charts the very beginning of the American Revolutionary War, and begins with Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda) and Hercules Mulligan (Okieriete Onaodowan) reaffirming their commitment to the fight. Alexander Hamilton is irritated that he cannot rise to a position of command in the Continental Army, as there is only one man who could award him such a position - General George Washington, who had been appointed commander-in-chief at the Second Continental Congress. Washington is then introduced by Aaron Burr, and discusses his frustration of his forces in the fight for control of New York City. Hamilton attempts to reverse the tide of the battle by capturing British cannons that were attacking his unit in the Battery. These actions bring Hamilton to the attention of Washington, who decides to recruit a right-hand man after retreating from Brooklyn. Burr applies for this role, but is dismissed in favor of Hamilton, who assumes the eponymous role at the song's conclusion.

3. Title: Red hands. Fact: One player extends their hands forward, roughly at arm's length, with the palms down. The other player's hands, also roughly at arm's length, are placed, palms up, under the first player's hands.

If the slapping player misses, the players swap roles and play again.

4. Title: Hands Up! (1926 film). Fact: The film tells the story of Jack, a spy for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, and his efforts to capture a Union shipment of gold. Obstacles along the way include a pair of sisters, hostile Indians, and a firing squad.

Question: How many people are in this picture of The Marcels?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Painting. Fact: For mysterious reasons, a Painter has left a work incomplete - causing conflict between the Toupins (Allduns), who are entirely painted, the Pafinis (Halfies), who lack a few colors, and the Reufs (Sketchies), who are only sketches. Toupins occupy the chateau, Pafinis are out in the gardens, and Reufs are treated as outcasts and hunted by the Toupins. Three friends, one of each class, go on a quest to find the artist so he can finish the piece and hopefully unite the people.

2. Title: Les Gentilshommes du Duc d'Orléans. Fact: The painting shows six "gentlemen"(French: "Gentilshommes") dressed in red frock coats and black stockings which was the outfit for the countryside of the House of Orléans. The six gentlemen are (from left to right): The Chevalier de Gax, the Marquis de Périgny, the Chevalier de Saint-Mars, the Chevalier d’Estrées, the Baron de Tourempé and the Chevalier Desparts.

3. Title: The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915. Fact: The painting shows a crowded table inside the restaurant of the Hôtel de la Tour Eiffel at 1 Percy Street, London. Around the table are the key members of Vorticism, a British abstract art movement that flourished briefly in the 1910s. The six seated men are, from left to right: Cuthbert Hamilton, Ezra Pound, William Roberts, Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells and Edward Wadsworth. Etchells holds a copy of the first issue of the Vorticist magazine "Blast". In the doorway to the left are the movement's two female members, Jessica Dismorr and Helen Saunders. Standing to the right are the waiter Joe and the restaurant's proprietor, Rudolph Stulik.

4. Title: Windsor Beauties. Fact: The Royal Collection includes 10 portraits as part of the set. They show the women at three-quarter length in various poses. Some women wear current fashions; others are draped in loose robes intended to evoke classical antiquity.

5. Title: At the Moulin Rouge. Fact: The painting portrays near its center a group of three men and two women sitting around a table situated on the floor of the cabaret. From right to left, the people at the table include: Édouard Dujardin, dancer La Macarona, photographer Paul Secau, and photographer Maurice Guibert. In the right foreground, apparently sitting at a different table, is a partial profile, with her face lit in a distinctive light, of English dancer May Milton. In the background on the right is Moulin Rouge dancer La Goulue and a woman. The center-left background shows Toulouse-Lautrec himself, as well as Gabriel Tapié de Céleyran.

Question: are tigers the biggest cat in the world
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Tiger. Fact: The tiger ("Panthera tigris") is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus "Panthera". It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

2. Title: Big cat. Fact: The liger can grow to be much larger than its parent species, the lion and tiger. In particular, a liger called 'Nook' is reported to have weighed over 550 kg (1,210 lb).

3. Title: Tiger. Fact: The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra. The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

4. Title: Bengal tiger. Fact: The Bengal tiger is a "Panthera tigris tigris" population native to the Indian subcontinent. It is threatened by poaching, loss, and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 individuals by 2011. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals. India's tiger population was estimated at 1,706–1,909 individuals in 2010. By 2018, the population had increased to an estimated 2,603–3,346 individuals. Around 440 tigers are estimated in Bangladesh, 163–253 tigers in Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan.

5. Title: Panthera. Fact: The tiger, lion, leopard, and jaguar are the only cat species with the anatomical structure that enables them to roar. The primary reason for this was formerly assumed to be the incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone. However, new studies show the ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx. The snow leopard does not roar. Although its hyoid bone is incompletely ossified, it lacks the special morphology of the larynx.

The focal point of the show and the inspiration for the event name was the main event steel cage match between four trios teams with each group "betting" something on the outcome of the match. Under the rules of the match the last wrestler in the cage would be deemed the loser along with his partners, losing their "bet", while the second to last person in the ring would be declared the winners of the same bet. "Los Psycho Circus" (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) placed their IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship on the line.

Question: what comic was roy of the rovers in
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Roy of the Rovers. Fact: The weekly strip ran until 1993, following Roy's playing career until its conclusion after he lost his left foot in a helicopter crash. When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly "Match of the Day" football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001.

2. Title: Roy of the Rovers (comic). Fact: The Roy of the Rovers comic was launched as a weekly on 25 September 1976, named after the established comic strip of the same name that first appeared as weekly feature in the Tiger on 11 September 1954. The title ran for 853 issues, until 20 March 1993[nb 1] (industrial action prevented publication of 3 issues in December 1978 and a further 5 in May and June 1980), and included other football strips and features. In February 1989, the comic merged with the similarly themed Hot Shot, and was known for a brief time as Roy of the Rovers and Hot Shot, but reverted to its original title shortly afterwards.

3. Title: Tom Tully (writer). Fact: Tom Tully was a noted British comic writer mostly of sports and action stories. He is probably most famous as the longest-running writer of the popular football-themed strip "Roy of the Rovers", which he wrote for much of Roy Race's playing career until the weekly comic closed in 1993.

4. Title: Yvonne Hutton. Fact: Yvonne Hutton (née Mullins; born 31 October 1941, died March 1992) was a British comics artist best known for her work on football series "Roy of the Rovers".

5. Title: Roy Carson. Fact: Roy Carson was a British hard-boiled detective created in 1948 by Denis McLoughlin and his brother Colin and first published by Boardman Books in their series of rotogravure comic books (1948–1954). Roy, with his plucky girl companion Silk, faced all manner of underworld adventures with an odd combination of American and British elements. Boardman Books also used Roy Carson in text stories published in their children's annuals in the 1950s. In the late-1950s and early 1960s, Roy Carson stories were reprinted in a number of British albums and annuals. In 1999, the comic fanzine "Best of British" #1 reprinted "Roy Carson and the Old Master", originally published in 1953.

Question: what state has the highest population of bears
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Chichagof Island. Fact: Chichagof Island has the highest population of bears per square mile of any place on Earth.

2. Title: Grizzly bear. Fact: There are currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears total located throughout North America, most of which reside in Alaska. Only about 1,500 grizzlies are left in the lower 48 states of the US. Of these, about 800 live in Montana. About 600 more live in Wyoming, in the Yellowstone-Teton area. There are an estimated 70–100 grizzly bears living in northern and eastern Idaho. Its original range included much of the Great Plains and the southwestern states, but it has been extirpated in most of those areas. Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range.

3. Title: Brown bear. Fact: The brown bear ("Ursus arctos") is a bear species that is found across much of northern Eurasia and North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are often called "grizzly bears". It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivalled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear ("Ursus maritimus"), which is much less variable in size and slightly larger on average.

4. Title: Bear Head Lake State Park. Fact: In September 2010, Bear Head Lake State Park was voted "America's Favorite Park" in a major online poll. The little-known park, not even among Minnesota's most popular, won in a surprise landslide, capturing 28% of the more than 5.7 million votes. The strong showing was credited to the online fan community of mother and cub black bears, featured on a popular webcam, whose territory included the park.

5. Title: The Sphinx (Wyoming). Fact: Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.

Question: What Classification is the album by UK band Seccond Person, and a musical genre that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Trip hop. Fact: Trip hop (sometimes called "downtempo") is a musical genre that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. It has been described as "a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognizable," and may incorporate a variety of styles, including funk, dub, soul, psychedelia, R&B, and house, as well as other forms of electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.

2. Title: Sandwell District. Fact: Sandwell District was established as a record label in 2002 by Regis (Karl O'Connor) and Female (Peter Sutton) as an extension of their Downwards Records label, which had been instrumental in shaping techno's Birmingham sound in the early 1990s. The label was revived in 2004 and from 2005 increasingly incorporated the artistic input of the New York City-based Function (David Sumner) and the Los Angeles-based Silent Servant (Juan Mendez). Initially releasing records under their own identities, as the label's success grew, it came to be seen increasingly as a collective entity, releasing tracks and albums anonymously partly in revolt against the increasingly celebrity-oriented DJ culture of the time, culminating in its 2010 collective album "Feed Forward".

3. Title: Process (EP). Fact: "Process" (catalogue number "O-Ton 109") is the 2017 debut EP by the techno group LSD, formed that year by Luke Slater, Steve Bicknell, and Function (aka Dave Sumner). The tracks described as focused on "the psychedelic aspects of techno", and an "interpretation of stroboscopic intensity on the summit of psychedelic experiences - permeated with moments of hypnotic and atonal melodies".

4. Title: Deviant Records. Fact: Deviant Records was a London-based record label founded by publisher and music producer Rob Deacon in the mid 90s, releasing electronic works that were at the cutting edge in their field - Pentatonik, Node (Flood, Ed Buller, Mel Wesson & Dave Bessell), Schematix, The Orb, Humate, Phat Gecko (Luke Corradine), Spooky and Witchman.

5. Title: D*Note. Fact: D*Note is a British experimental dance band, founded primarily by musician Matt Winn (aka Matt Wienevski, born 20 September 1965). The band emerged in London in 1993 with their debut album "Babel", which reflected an acid jazz background.

Question: when was ain't added to the dictionary
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Ain't. Fact: Webster's Third New International Dictionary, published in 1961, went against then-standard practice when it included the following usage note in its entry on ain't: "though disapproved by many and more common in less educated speech, used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers esp. in the phrase ain't I." Many commentators disapproved of the dictionary's relatively permissive attitude toward the word, which was inspired, in part, by the belief of its editor, Philip Gove, that "distinctions of usage were elitist and artificial."

2. Title: Webster's Third New International Dictionary. Fact: The final definition, Zyzzogeton, was written on October 17, 1960; the final etymology was recorded on October 26; and the final pronunciation was transcribed on November 9. The final copy went to the typesetters, RR Donnelley, on December 2. The book was printed by the Riverside Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first edition had 2,726 pages (measuring wide by tall by thick), weighed 13½ lb (6.12 kg), and originally sold for $47.50 ($ in dollars). The changes were the most radical in the history of the "Unabridged".

3. Title: Why Johnny Can't Add. Fact: Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math is a 1973 book by Morris Kline, in which the author severely criticized the teaching practices characteristic of the "New Math" fashion for school teaching, which were based on Bourbaki's approach to mathematical research, and were being pushed into schools in the United States. Reactions were immediate, and the book became a best seller in its genre and translated into many languages.

4. Title: Isn't Wasn't Ain't. Fact: Isn't Wasn't Ain't is the debut album by Christian parody band ApologetiX, originally released in 1993. The album was re-released in 2003 and 2005.

5. Title: Ain't Nothing. Fact: Ain't Nothing is a song by American rapper Juicy J, released on February 3, 2017 as the second official single from his fourth solo studio album "Rubba Band Business" (2017). The song features guest appearances from fellow artists Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla Sign.

Question: Which drink is considered a highball, a Rickey or a Greyhound?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rickey (cocktail). Fact: The rickey is a highball drink made from gin or bourbon, half of a lime squeezed and dropped in the glass, and carbonated water. Little or no sugar is added to the rickey. Originally created with bourbon in Washington, D.C. at Shoomaker's bar by bartender George A. Williamson in the 1880s, purportedly in collaboration with Democratic lobbyist Colonel Joe Rickey, it became a worldwide sensation when mixed with gin a decade later.

2. Title: Greyhound (cocktail). Fact: A greyhound is a cocktail consisting of grapefruit juice and either gin or vodka mixed and served over ice. If the rim of the glass has been salted, the drink is instead called a salty dog.

3. Title: Whiskey highball. Fact: A whiskey highball or ginger ale highball is a two-ingredient cocktail consisting of whiskey (typically rye whiskey, as its spicy notes complement those of the ginger ale) and ginger ale or (to make a whisky soda) plain soda water. When Irish whiskey is used, it is an Irish buck. Variations include the Mamie Taylor, Presbyterian, Irish Gold, John Collins, Whiskey fizz, Seven and Seven, and Leprechaun.

4. Title: Horsefeather (cocktail). Fact: A horsefeather is traditionally rye whiskey or blended whiskey, ginger beer, three dashes of Angostura bitters, and a little lemon juice. A highball glass is filled 3/4 with ice. The ingredients are then poured into the glass and stirred. There are many variations such as substituting ginger beer with ginger ale, adding cherries, muddling the lemon, replacing the lemon with lime, or creating a frozen version.

5. Title: Highball. Fact: Highball is the name for a family of mixed alcoholic drinks that are composed of an alcoholic base spirit and a larger proportion of a non-alcoholic mixer. Well-known examples of highballs include the Seven and Seven, Scotch and soda, and rum and Coke. A highball is typically served over ice in a large straight-sided highball glass or Collins glass.

Question: Margot at the Wedding has how many main characters, as portrayed on the front cover?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Wedding (Steel novel). Fact: The Wedding is a romance novel written by American writer Danielle Steel and published in April 2000 . Set in Los Angeles, against a star-studded backdrop, it follows a busy career woman as she meets the man of her dreams, falls in love and plans her wedding. It was first on the "New York Times" Best Seller list.

2. Title: The Wedding! (comics). Fact: "The Wedding!" is a story from "The Amazing Spider-Man Annual" #21 in which Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker (a.k.a. Spider-Man) get married. It was published in 1987 and written by David Michelinie, featuring cover art by John Romita Sr.

3. Title: The Wedding Hotel. Fact: A group of artists and journalists enjoy a series of romantic entanglements in a country hotel. An author, Vera von Eichberg "of whom no photo exists," has mentioned the hotel in her work, increasing its clientele. When another female guest arrives, everyone assumes she is the author, despite her repeated assertions to the contrary.

4. Title: The Party Line (books). Fact: The Party Line is series of books by Carrie Austen, dedicated specially to teenage girls. Several covers were painted by illustrator Mike Wimmer.

5. Title: The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even. Fact: It is at first sight baffling in iconography and unclassifiable style. Yet this glass construction is not a discrete whole. "The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even" is also the title given to "The Green Box" notes (1934) as Duchamp intended the "Large Glass" to be accompanied by a book, in order to prevent purely visual responses to it. The notes describe that his "hilarious picture" is intended to depict the erotic encounter between the "Bride", in the upper panel, and her nine "Bachelors" gathered timidly below in an abundance of mysterious mechanical apparatus in the lower panel. "The Large Glass" was exhibited in 1926 at the Brooklyn Museum before it was broken during transport and carefully repaired by Duchamp. It is now part of the permanent collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Duchamp sanctioned replicas of "The Large Glass", the first in 1961 for an exhibition at Moderna Museet in Stockholm and another in 1966 for the Tate Gallery in London. The third replica is in Komaba Museum, University of Tokyo.

This article of clothing typically has a low, round neckline that can be worn for athletic purposes.

Question: what does the sun symbolize in the philippine flag
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flag of the Philippines. Fact: The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty, equality, and fraternity; a horizontal blue stripe for peace, truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism and valor. In the center of the white triangle is an eight-rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people's democracy, and sovereignty. Each ray represents a province with significant involvement in the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain; these provinces are Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Bataan, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija (some sources specify other provinces as alternatives to some of these[a]). However, according to the Declaration of Independence and a research by UP Professor Ambeth Ocampo, the rays of the sun symbolized the first 8 provinces of the Philippines which was declared under martial law during the First Philippine Revolution. Three five-pointed stars, one for each of the triangle's points, stand for the three major island groups where the revolution started: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

2. Title: Coat of arms of the Philippines. Fact: The Coat of arms of the Philippines (; ) features the eight-rayed sun of the Philippines with each ray representing the eight provinces (Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Manila, Laguna, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac) which were placed under martial law by Governor-General Ramón Blanco during the Philippine Revolution, and the three five-pointed stars representing the three primary geographic regions of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

3. Title: Flag of Bohol. Fact: The Flag of Bohol is a vertical triband bearing the three main colors of the Philippine flag, with the white field usually being wider than the blue or red stripes. According to the official interpretation of the flag's symbolism, the color blue represents nobility; white, purity; and red, courage.

4. Title: Flag of the President of the Philippines. Fact: The Flag of the President of the Philippines (Filipino: "Watawat ng Pangulo ng Pilipinas") consists of the Presidential Coat-of-Arms on a blue background. While having the same design as the Presidential Seal since 1947, the Flag has a separate history, and the designs on the Flag and Seal have at different times influenced each other.

5. Title: Flag of Batangas. Fact: The Flag of Batangas is a horizontal triband of blue, white and red — the main colors of the Philippine flag — with the provincial seal in the center.

Question: Does Biohazard (band) perform live?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Biohazard (band). Fact: Biohazard is an American band formed in Brooklyn, New York, in 1987. They are acknowledged as one of the earliest bands to fuse hardcore punk and heavy metal with elements of hip hop. The earliest lineup consisted of bassist-vocalist Evan Seinfeld, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Anthony Meo. Guitarist-vocalist Billy Graziadei would join the band soon after, changing the band to a four-piece. Since February 2016, the lineup has consisted of Graziadei, Hambel, and Danny Schuler.

2. Title: Biohazard (band). Fact: The band formed in Brooklyn in 1987. Their first demo, released in 1988, caused a stir with journalists who felt that some of the band's lyrics displayed fascist and white supremacist views, overlooking that both Seinfeld and Schuler were, themselves, Jewish. The accusations of racism in their music were something strenuously denied by the band but in later interviews, Seinfeld and Graziadei explained that it had been a publicity stunt to win over the band Carnivore and their fans. Additionally, Seinfeld has defended the lyrics of songs such as "Master Race" and "America" as metaphors meant to shock and get the listener's attention and maintains that the band was never racist. The band has long since preached a message of tolerance and anti-racism. After the release of the first demo, Anthony Meo left the band and drummer Danny Schuler replaced him. A second demo tape followed in 1989.

3. Title: Live Evolution. Fact: Live Evolution is the title of a 2001 live album and a DVD released by the American progressive metal band Queensrÿche. It was recorded over two nights (July 27–28, 2001) at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington. On the CD the tracks were collected in suites, which represent different moments of the band production and include a large section of the concept album "". The DVD contains footage shot at the same concerts and features less songs listed in the order they were played during the shows.

4. Title: Synthesis Live. Fact: The tour was announced by the band on August 14, 2017, in a video posted on their official Facebook account. It was revealed that they would be joined by an orchestra to perform reworked versions of some of their well-known songs included on their fourth studio album, "Synthesis" (2017). For each city on the tour, a local orchestra is assembled by the show's conductor, Susie Seiter. According to the band's lead singer Amy Lee, the goal behind the performances of the tour was to emphasize the vocal performance, emotions and stories behind the lyrics of the band's songs. With the purchase of tickets for the concerts, concertgoers received a free download of the album along with an instant download of the reworked version of "Bring Me to Life" included on "Synthesis".

5. Title: Dead & Company Summer Tour 2018. Fact: Prior to the 2018 Summer Tour, in addition to the three rescheduled dates from the 2017 Fall tour, the band performed three shows — February 15, 17 and 18 — at the Barceló Maya resort in Riviera Maya, Mexico. The event, billed as a "concert vacation", was called "Playing In The Sand" (a pun on the Grateful Dead song "Playing in the Band").

Question: What is Elmer Fudd holding?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Gund. Fact: Gund is a Canadian-owned manufacturer of plush stuffed animals. The company is based in Edison, New Jersey, and distributes throughout the United States and Canada as well as in Europe, Japan, Australia, and South America. Gund is currently run by third generation family owner Bruce Raiffe whose grandfather Jacob Swedlin purchased the company from the original founder (Adolph Gund) in 1925.

2. Title: Hold Anything. Fact: Hold Anything was the third short in the "Looney Tunes" series from Warner Bros., released to theaters in October 1930. Featuring Bosko (the star of "Looney Tunes" shorts of that time), it was loosely based on the lost film "Hold Everything", one of whose songs, "Don't Hold Everything," features prominently in the cartoon. It was directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising, and animated by Isadore "Friz" Freleng and Norman Blackburn.

3. Title: Oobi (toy). Fact: Physically, an Oobi is a bright orange oblong spheroid with a slit, an addressing area, and big painted-on eyes. They were sold in packs of three. The original purchaser was to write an address on the address area, place a folded message inside, and leave the toy somewhere public to be found. Instructions to the finder were written on the Oobi's top: "I'm oobi. I contain a message to another human being. Please further my journey an inch, a foot, or a mile. Add a note, if you wish. Then help me to the next nice person like yourself! I'm on my way to ... Please don't confine me to a mailbox."

4. Title: Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Fact: The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is a fictional character from the "Ghostbusters" franchise, which sometimes appears as a giant, lumbering paranormal monster. It first appears in the "Ghostbusters" (1984) film as a picture logo on a prop package of marshmallows in Dana Barrett's apartment, on a graffiti advertisement on the building next to the Ghostbusters' HQ, and then in the climax of the film as the physical manifestation of the Sumerian deity Gozer. Subsequently, it has been incorporated into many other Ghostbusters media, including the animated series "The Real Ghostbusters", comic books, a stage show, and video games.

5. Title: Hold Anything. Fact: The film features Bosko working on a construction site with a goat and several small mice (all of which bear a strong resemblance to Mickey Mouse; Harman and Ising had worked with Walt Disney for several years before joining Warner Bros.). After several minutes of relatively uneventful working (marked mainly by a song and dance sequence in which one of the mice is temporarily decapitated), Bosko spots his girlfriend, Honey, working in a nearby office building. After some brief flirtation, Bosko jumps down into Honey's office, pulls out a piece of sheet music, places it in Honey's typewriter, and begins playing the typewriter like a piano (Bosko types the words "Don't Hold Everything" before launching into the song). Meanwhile, back at the construction site, the goat eats a steam-powered machine and begins to float upward. Bosko reaches out the window and begins playing the goat like a pipe organ. The goat begins to float away, and as Bosko hangs on for his life, he accidentally grabs onto a set of udders and gets sprayed with milk, distracting him enough to lose his grip and fall onto a set of bricks. Bosko inexplicably divides into six miniature Boskos and begins playing the bricks as a xylophone before he reforms to his usual self and the cartoon irises out.

Question: What color are the gloves worn in Muttley?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Kidskin. Fact: Kidskin or kid leather is a type of soft, thin leather that is traditionally used for gloves (hence the phrase 'kid gloves,' used since at least 1888 as a metaphor for careful handling). It is widely used for other fashion purposes such as footwear and clothing. Kidskin is traditionally made from goatskin - more specifically, the skin of young goats (or 'kids'), although equivalent leathers such as lambskin and chickenskin (actually a form of calfskin) give the same effect.

2. Title: Darlexx. Fact: Darlexx, a product of the Shawmut Corporation, is a warp knit fabric laminated to a monolithic film. It is a sports performance fabric used in gloves, boots, wet suits, ski apparel, clean rooms, and in medical applications. It was designed to keep a person "warm when the environment is cold and cool when the environment is hot" and is breathable, windproof, and waterproof.

3. Title: Suede. Fact: Suede is a type of fuzzy leather with a napped finish, commonly used for jackets, shoes, shirts, purses, furniture, and other items. The term comes from the French , which literally means "gloves from Sweden".

4. Title: Baldwin guinea pig. Fact: Baldwins are known for having skin of a rubbery texture, lots of wrinkles and large, droopy ears. They come in all colors and patterns that haired guinea pigs come in, such as Dutch, tortoiseshell, broken colors, Himalayan and selfs.

5. Title: Bunny boots. Fact: Bunny boots or Mickey Mouse boots (depending on the version) are the most common nicknames for the Extreme Cold Vapor Barrier Boots (Types I and II) used by the United States military. These large, bulbous waterproof rubber boots are worn only in extremely cold weather (-20°F to -60°F), with the liner-free interior retaining warmth by sandwiching up to one inch of wool and felt insulation between two vacuum-tight layers of rubber; this vacuum layer insulates the wearer's feet similar to a Thermos flask. These boots were originally developed at the Navy Clothing and Textile Research Center in Natick, Massachusetts, for use during the Korean War.

Question: What is the woman on the Almost Famous poster wearing on her eyes?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Larmes. Fact: The photograph is an extreme close-up of a woman's upturned face with glass droplets placed on her cheeks to imitate tears. Differing interpretations have been given for the meaning of the photograph. Art historian Erin C. Garcia wrote that Ray "emulated the melodrama that compensated for the lack of dialogue in silent films" in "Larmes" and likened the model's eyes to "insect-like creatures with hundreds of legs", and another critic wondered whether the image was "ridiculing female crocodile tears, or pouring scorn on the men who are taken in by such sentimentalism".

2. Title: Margaret Keane. Fact: Margaret D. H. Keane (born Peggy Doris Hawkins, September 15, 1927) is an American artist known for her paintings of subjects with big eyes. She mainly paints women, children, or animals in oil or mixed media. The work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates, and cups. It has been critically acclaimed. The artwork was originally attributed to Keane's husband, Walter Keane. After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after a court "paint-off" in Hawaii.

3. Title: Amanda Lepore. Fact: Amanda Lepore (born November 21, 1967) is an American model, celebutante, singer, and performance artist. A former Club Kid, she has appeared in advertising for numerous companies. Lepore is also noted as a regular subject in photographer David LaChapelle's work, serving as his muse, as well as many other photographers, such as Terry Richardson and Ruben van Schalm. She participated in LaChapelle's "Artists and Prostitutes 1985–2005" exhibit in New York City, where she "lived" in a voyeuristic life-sized set.

4. Title: Natalie Irish. Fact: Natalie Irish (born 8 October 1982) is a Houston-based visual artist. Her mediums include metal, paint, clay, fabric, and charcoal, but she has gained attention for portraits created using lipstick. She gained media attention in 2011 for her lip print portraits of pop icons such as Marilyn Monroe, Jimi Hendrix, and Roy Rogers.

5. Title: Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau. Fact: Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau (née Avegno, 29 January 1859 – 25 July 1915) was born in New Orleans but grew up from the age of eight in France, where she became a Parisian socialite known for her beauty. She occasionally posed as a model for notable artists. She is most widely known as the subject of John Singer Sargent's painting "Portrait of Madame X" (1884). It created a social scandal when shown at the Paris Salon.

Question: Leopold VI, was the Duke of Syria from 1194, and had the title of which medieval principality, of the Holy Roman Empire, from 1198 to his death in 1230?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Leopold VI, Duke of Austria. Fact: Leopold VI (German: Luitpold VI. von Österreich, 1176 – 28 July 1230), known as Leopold the Glorious (German: Luitpold der Glorreiche), was the Duke of Styria from 1194 and the Duke of Austria from 1198 to his death in 1230. He was a member of the House of Babenberg. He was also a member of the Chapter of the Cistercian Order. Like his predecessors, he attempted to develop the land by founding monasteries. His most important foundation is Lilienfeld in the Lower Austrian valley of the Traisen river, where he was buried after his death. Besides that, he supported the then highly modern Mendicant Orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans.  He is arguably one of the greatest of the Babenbergs.

2. Title: Conrad of Montferrat. Fact: Conrad of Montferrat (Italian: "Corrado del Monferrato"; Piedmontese: "Conrà ëd Monfrà") (died 28 April 1192) was a north Italian nobleman, one of the major participants in the Third Crusade. He was the "de facto" King of Jerusalem (as Conrad I) by marriage from 24 November 1190, but officially elected only in 1192, days before his death. He was also the eighth Marquess of Montferrat from 1191.

3. Title: Baldwin I, Latin Emperor. Fact: Baldwin I (; ; July 1172 – ) was the first emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople. As Count of Flanders and Hainaut, he was one of the most prominent leaders of the Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the sack of Constantinople and the conquest of large parts of the Byzantine Empire, and the foundation of the Latin Empire. He lost his final battle to Kaloyan, the emperor of Bulgaria, and spent his last days as his prisoner.

4. Title: Duchy of Austria. Fact: The Duchy of Austria (German: Herzogtum Österreich) was a medieval principality of the Holy Roman Empire, established in 1156 by the Privilegium Minus, when the Margraviate of Austria (Ostarrîchi) was detached from Bavaria and elevated to a duchy in its own right. After the ruling dukes of the House of Babenberg became extinct, the German king Rudolf I took over the dominion as the first monarch of the Habsburg dynasty in 1276. Thereafter, Austria became the ancestral homeland of the dynasty and the nucleus of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1453, the archducal title of the Austrian rulers, invented by Duke Rudolf IV in the forged Privilegium Maius of 1359, was officially acknowledged by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III.

5. Title: Lothair I. Fact: Lothair I or Lothar I (Dutch and Medieval Latin: "Lotharius", German: "Lothar", French: "Lothaire", Italian: "Lotario") (795 – 29 September 855) was the Holy Roman Emperor (817–855, co-ruling with his father until 840), and the governor of Bavaria (815–817), King of Italy (818–855) and Middle Francia (840–855).

Question: In Torpedo, what is in the diver's right hand?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Human torpedo. Fact: Human torpedoes or manned torpedoes are a type of diver propulsion vehicle on which the diver rides, generally in a seated position behind a fairing. They were used as secret naval weapons in World War II. The basic concept is still in use.

2. Title: Torpedo. Fact: A modern torpedo is a self-propelled weapon with an explosive warhead, launched above or below the water surface, propelled underwater towards a target, and designed to detonate either on contact with its target or in proximity to it.

3. Title: Torpedo (petroleum). Fact: A torpedo consisted of canisters that were filled with an explosive and lowered into a well via a rope or wire. Gunpowder was used in the first torpedoes, but nitroglycerin was found to work better despite its instability. The well is usually filled with water to prevent the explosion from escaping upwards. Originally, the topmost canister had a percussion cap that was to detonate the main charge. An iron weight was dropped down the well to set the torpedo off. After incidents of premature explosions, a second method was developed in which a tube of the explosive was placed in a larger tube that was packed with sand. A fuse was wound around the inner tube, connected to a blasting cap. When the torpedo was to be used, the inner tube was filled with nitroglycerin and corked; the fuse was lit and torpedo was dropped down the well.

4. Title: Trongle. Fact: Trongle is a device used on submarines to help swimmers, especially the naval special forces, to locate a submerged submarine in order that they may return to it. The trongle was invented by Captain John Moore of the Royal Navy.

5. Title: Bathythermograph. Fact: The bathythermograph, or BT, also known as the Mechanical Bathythermograph, or MBT; is a small torpedo-shaped device that holds a temperature sensor and a transducer to detect changes in water temperature versus depth down to a depth of approximately 285 meters (935 feet). Lowered by a small winch on the ship into the water, the BT records pressure and temperature changes on a coated glass slide as it is dropped nearly freely through the water. While the instrument is being dropped, the wire is paid out until it reaches a predetermined depth, then a brake is applied and the BT is drawn back to the surface. Because the pressure is a function of depth (see Pascal's law), temperature measurements can be correlated with the depth at which they are recorded.

Question: are there supposed to be subtitles in dances with wolves
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dances with Wolves. Fact: Costner developed the film with an initial budget of $15 million. Dances with Wolves had high production values and won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Much of the dialogue is spoken in Lakota with English subtitles. It was shot in South Dakota and Wyoming, and translated by Albert White Hat, the chair of the Lakota Studies Department at Sinte Gleska University.

2. Title: Subtitles. Fact: Subtitles are text derived from either a transcript or screenplay of the dialog or commentary in films, television programs, video games, and the like, usually displayed at the bottom of the screen, but can also be at the top of the screen if there is already text at the bottom of the screen. They can either be a form of written translation of a dialog in a foreign language, or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language, with or without added information to help viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow the dialog, or people who cannot understand the spoken dialogue or who have accent recognition problems.

3. Title: Closed captioning. Fact: HTML5 defines subtitles as a "transcription or translation of the dialogue ... when sound is available but not understood" by the viewer (for example, dialogue in a foreign language) and captions as a "transcription or translation of the dialogue, sound effects, relevant musical cues, and other relevant audio information ... when sound is unavailable or not clearly audible" (for example, when audio is muted or the viewer is deaf or hard of hearing).

4. Title: Subtitles. Fact: The encoded method can either be pre-rendered with the video or separate as either a graphic or text to be rendered and overlaid by the receiver. The separate subtitles are used for DVD, Blu-ray and television teletext/Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) subtitling or EIA-608 captioning, which are hidden unless requested by the viewer from a menu or remote controller key or by selecting the relevant page or service (e.g., p. 888 or CC1), always carry additional sound representations for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. Teletext subtitle language follows the original audio, except in multi-lingual countries where the broadcaster may provide subtitles in additional languages on other teletext pages. EIA-608 captions are similar, except that North American Spanish stations may provide captioning in Spanish on CC3. DVD and Blu-ray only differ in using run-length encoded graphics instead of text, as well as some HD DVB broadcasts.

5. Title: No Subtitles Necessary: Laszlo & Vilmos. Fact: No Subtitles Necessary: Laszlo & Vilmos is a 2008 American documentary film written and directed by James Chressanthis.

Question: What color dress is the woman wearing in the Tanu Weds Manu poster?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Woman in Hat and Fur Collar. Fact: The Woman in Hat and Fur Collar (Marie-Thérèse Walter) is a painting by Pablo Picasso exhibited at the National Art Museum of Catalonia (Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) in Barcelona, Spain.

2. Title: White bikini of Ursula Andress. Fact: Andress's white bikini is regarded as monumental in the history of the bikini, and sales of the two-piece bikini rocketed after the appearance of Andress in "Dr. No". The lower part of the bikini features a wide white British Army belt with brass buckles and fittings, and a scabbard on the left side to hold a large knife.

3. Title: Rachel Antonoff. Fact: Rachel Antonoff is a fashion designer based in New York City. She is known for presenting her designs in creative ways, including in the form of a murder mystery, as a "sock hop," and in a dollhouse. In 2015, director and actress Lena Dunham promoted Antonoff's collaboration with & Other Stories in a short film called "Vote Audrey". Dunham famously wore Antonoff's Uterus Sweater to a Planned Parenthood event where she then auctioned it off to raise an additional $4,000 for the cause. The text of her popular 2013 "I'm With Her" sweatshirt transcended into politics after Hillary Clinton's campaign adopted "I'm With Her" as the campaign's slogan. Antonoff starred in and was the creative director for the music video for Tegan and Sara's "Boyfriend" in 2016.

4. Title: A Woman With No Clothes On. Fact: The aristocratic Manet and the working-class Victorine Meurent narrate "A Woman With No Clothes On". A chance meeting between the two leads to an intense relationship of painting and sexual tension. Manet creates a scandal when he exhibits "Le déjeuner sur l'herbe" and "Olympia" in which the naked model is a young Victorine. While critics and the general public dismiss the works, and label Victorine a common prostitute, she is determined to make her mark in the art world as a painter in her own right. Her bitter struggle to succeed is punctuated by the exchanges between Manet and his friend Baudelaire on the matter of modernism.

5. Title: Men's Wear. Fact: Men's Wear is a 1953 painting by Australian artist John Brack. The painting depicts the interior of a menswear store, including the proprietor and some mannequins, standing in front of displays of ties and trousers. A mirror in the background reflects a silhouette of the artist.

Question: Queen Mab, is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet", where "she is the fairies' midwife", in her play, her activity is described in a famous speech by which fictional character in William Shakespeare's 1597 tragedy, a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Queen Mab. Fact: Queen Mab (pronunciation: "M/ă/v")[citation needed] is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, where "she is the fairies' midwife."  Later, she appears in other poetry and literature, and in various guises in drama and cinema. In the play, her activity is described in a famous speech by Mercutio written originally in prose and often adapted into iambic pentameter, in which she is described as a miniature creature who performs midnight pranks upon sleepers.  Being driven by a team of atomies, she rides her chariot over their noses and "delivers the fancies of sleeping men."  Additionally, while driving "O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream," she was known to change her mind and instead "plague" "ladies' lips" "with blisters" if she smelled "sweetmeats" or candied fruit eaten to sweeten their breath.  Along with this interpretation, others[who?] believe the blisters were a reference to the plague or to herpes simplex. She is also described as a midwife to help sleepers 'give birth' to their dreams. She may be a figure borrowed from folklore, and though she is often associated with the Irish Medb in popular culture, and has been suggested by historian Thomas Keightley to be from Habundia, a more likely origin for her name would be from Mabel and the Middle English derivative "Mabily" (as used by Chaucer) all from the Latin amabilis ("lovable").

2. Title: Mercutio. Fact: Mercutio (/mərˈkjuːʃioʊ/ mər-KEW-shee-oh) is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's 1597 tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. He is a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris. As such, being neither a Montague nor a Capulet, Mercutio is one of the few in Verona with the ability to mingle around those of both houses. The invitation to Capulet's party states that he has a brother named Valentine.

3. Title: Sycorax. Fact: Sycorax is an unseen character in William Shakespeare's play "The Tempest" (1611). She is a vicious and powerful witch and the mother of Caliban, one of the few native inhabitants of the island on which Prospero, the hero of the play, is stranded. She is originally from 'Argier,' defined by geographer Mohamed. S. E. Madiou as "a 16th and 17th century older English-based exonym for both the 16th and 17th c. capital and state of ‘Algiers’ (Argier/Argier)," from where Sycorax is banished.

4. Title: Ophelia. Fact: Ophelia  is a character in William Shakespeare's drama "Hamlet". She is a young noblewoman of Denmark, the daughter of Polonius, sister of Laertes, and potential wife of Prince Hamlet.

5. Title: Lady Bertilak. Fact: Lady Bertilak is a character in the medieval poem "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". She is ordered by her husband, the Green Knight, or Lord Bertilak, to test Sir Gawain's purity.



Answer the following question: 'Queen Mab, is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet", where "she is the fairies' midwife", in her play, her activity is described in a famous speech by which fictional character in William Shakespeare's 1597 tragedy, a close friend to Romeo and a blood relative to Prince Escalus and Count Paris?'

Question: What color is the woman's hair, who Romeo is kissing?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Romeo (Dolly Parton song). Fact: "People" described the song as featuring Cyrus "as a growling male sex object who is subjected to leering catcalls by Dolly and sidekicks...This equal-opportunity misbehavior is the most memorable thing about 'Romeo.'"

2. Title: Sir or Madam. Fact: A woman disguises herself as a man, and poses as a gentleman's valet. She then has to resist the advances of his vampish fiancee.

3. Title: Pretty Flamingo. Fact: The speaker describes a woman—whom "all of the guys call [...] 'Flamingo', 'cause her hair glows like the sun and her eyes can light the sky"—for whom the singer has fallen, and his plans to win her affection.

4. Title: Monamour. Fact: Marta is a young nymphomaniac housewife, married to Dario, a successful book publisher. Although she still loves her husband, Marta hasn't been able to achieve sexual satisfaction for months due to their dull and predictable love life. While staying in Mantua for the Festivaletteratura, a book fair, Marta follows the advice of her scheming friend Sylvia and pursues an affair with a handsome and mysterious artist named Leon, which leads to surprising results regarding her failing marriage with Dario.

5. Title: The Kiss (Rodin sculpture). Fact: The sculpture, "The Kiss", was originally titled Francesca da Rimini, as it depicts the 13th-century Italian noblewoman immortalised in Dante's "Inferno" (Circle 2, Canto 5) who falls in love with her husband Giovanni Malatesta's younger brother Paolo. Having fallen in love while reading the story of Lancelot and Guinevere, the couple are discovered and killed by Francesca's husband. In the sculpture, the book can be seen in Paolo's hand. The lovers' lips do not actually touch in the sculpture, suggesting that they were interrupted and met their demise without their lips ever having touched.

Question: Does William Shakespeare have long or short hair in this image?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Portraits of Shakespeare. Fact: There is no concrete evidence that Shakespeare ever commissioned a portrait, and there is no written description of his physical appearance. However, it is thought that portraits of him did circulate during his lifetime because of a reference to one in the anonymous play "Return from Parnassus" (c. 1601), in which a character says "O sweet Mr Shakespeare! I'll have his picture in my study at the court."

2. Title: Sanders portrait. Fact: The Sanders portrait is reputed to be one of the only images of William Shakespeare done in his lifetime. It features a middle-aged man wearing a black doublet with silver ornamentation. It also has a label affixed to the back which reads:

3. Title: Wig. Fact: A wig is a head covering made from human hair, animal hair, or synthetic fiber. The word wig is short for periwig, which makes its earliest known appearance in the English language in William Shakespeare's "The Two Gentlemen of Verona". Some people wear wigs to disguise baldness; a wig may be used as a less intrusive and less expensive alternative to medical therapies for restoring hair or for a religious reason.

4. Title: Arundel Head. Fact: The head is all that remains of a life-size bronze statue. The artist has realistically conveyed the worn features of an old man, including a wrinkled forehead, almond-shaped eyes and pouting mouth, which gives the portrait an air of power and authority. The hair of this bronze masterpiece is tied down in a ribbon, which suggests it may have portrayed a poet. Once thought to represent the ancient Greek writer Homer, it is currently considered to personify either the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles or a Macedonian King.

5. Title: Caesar cut. Fact: The Caesar cut is a hairstyle with short, horizontally straight cut bangs. The hair is layered to around 2–5 cm (1-2 inches) all over. It is named after the Roman Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar, whose images frequently depict him wearing his hair in such a manner. This haircut first became fashionable among Western boys and men in the 1950s.

Question: Battle of Tarawa and Operation Overlord, occurred during which event?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Battle of Tarawa. Fact: The Battle of Tarawa was a battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that was fought on 20–23 November 1943. It took place at the Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands, and was part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. invasion of the Gilberts.  Nearly 6,400 Japanese, Koreans, and Americans died in the fighting, mostly on and around the small island of Betio, in the extreme southwest of Tarawa Atoll.

2. Title: Battle of Tarakan (1942). Fact: The Battle of Tarakan took place on January 11–12, 1942, beginning a day after the Empire of Japan declared war on the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although Tarakan was only a small marshy island off northeastern Borneo in the Netherlands East Indies, the island's 700 oil wells, oil refinery, and airfield made it a crucial objective for Japan in the Pacific War.

3. Title: Operation Overlord. Fact: Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy, the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II. The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune, commonly known as D-Day). A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June, and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August.

4. Title: Operation U-Go. Fact: The U Go offensive, or Operation C (ウ号作戦 "U Gō sakusen"), was the Japanese offensive launched in March 1944 against forces of the British Empire in the northeast Indian regions of Manipur and the Naga Hills (then administered as part of Assam). Aimed at the Brahmaputra valley, through the two towns of Imphal and Kohima, the offensive along with the overlapping Ha Go offensive was one of the last major Japanese offensives during the Second World War. The offensive culminated in the Battles of Imphal and Kohima, where the Japanese and their allies were first held and then pushed back.

5. Title: First Battle of Tarain. Fact: The contemporary sources for the battle include "Tajul-Ma'asir" of Hasan Nizami (on the Ghurid side) and Jayanaka's "Prithviraja Vijaya" (on the Chahamana side).

Question: Is Manon's clothing shiny?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Nábrók. Fact: Nábrók (calqued as necropants, literally "corpse britches") are a pair of pants made from the skin of a dead man, which are believed in Icelandic witchcraft to be capable of producing an endless supply of money. It is unlikely these pants ever existed outside of folklore.

2. Title: Rhassoul. Fact: Rhassoul, or ghassoul , is a cosmetic made of natural mineral clay mined from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is combined with water to clean the body and has been used by North African women for centuries to care for their skin and hair. Rhassoul contains silica, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium, lithium and trace elements.

3. Title: Jarlaxle. Fact: Slender and tightly muscled, Jarlaxle is the dandy of Menzoberranzan. He chooses the brightest colors for his clothes and wears a cape that shines in every color in both the visible and infrared spectrums. A mental command can transform this bright cloak into a concealing piwafwi (Drow cloak of invisibility). Jarlaxle commonly wears high boots, bracelets and other jewelry that typically makes loud noise upon his approach (the jewelry jangling and the boots loudly echoing upon the floor, even upon surfaces such as soft carpeting where such sounds should not be possible), but which, like the cloak, can be made to be loud or silent at his discretion. He also wears a magical eye patch that protects his mind from magical and psionic intrusions and allows him to see through walls and other solid objects. He often shifts the patch from eye to eye to keep others guessing as to its powers. He wears a magical bracer which supplies him with an infinite supply of throwing knives (each knife, after being thrown, returns to the bracer and only one in three are real though illusions can still hurt if you believe in them). These daggers can also elongate into fine swords with just a couple flicks of his wrist. Another staple item is his wide-brimmed hat, plumed with a diatryma feather and worn atop his clean-shaven scalp that is heavily implied to be enchanted to have many different properties, including ones activated by tipping it in different directions. One of Jarlaxle's practiced moves is to remove his hat and sweep into a bow, exposing his bald head. Jarlaxle's shaven head is a symbol of his place in Menzoberranzan. In a society where rank and position are indicated by hair style (e.g., male drow nobles all have haircuts specific to their houses), Jarlaxle has no hair to illustrate that he considers himself to be apart from Drow society.

4. Title: Jennifer Ouellette (milliner). Fact: Jennifer Ouellette is a milliner based in New York City and Santiago de los Caballeros. She designs hats for both men and women, in addition to headbands and other hair accessories for the "everyday modern girl." Ouellette's headbands and hair accessories are distinctive in that traditional millinery techniques are used to ensure a comfortable and secure fit, like a well-designed hat.

5. Title: Trisana Chandler. Fact: Trisana Chandler, Tris for short, is a character in Tamora Pierce's "Circle of Magic" and "Circle Opens" quartets (see "Shatterglass") and the book "The Will of the Empress". She has curly red hair (her friend Briar calls her "Coppercurls"), gray eyes, and wears spectacles. She believes herself to be fat and is called "Fatty" a few times by some of the series' crueler characters. Later, when she obtains her mage's credential, she does her hair in numerous braids. Her magic is with weather and her braids are her mage kit, each one storing things like lightning and wind. Her braids do not store rain, however, as it makes her hair go frizzy.

Question: What is Don Giovanni holding in his right hand?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Ludovisi Dionysus. Fact: The formula, with somewhat exaggerated "contrapposto", the god's right hand resting on his head, is based on the Apollo Lyceus, which is variously attributed and dated. This ivy-crowned Dionysus is accompanied by the panther that signalises his numinous presence, and a satyr of reduced size, a member of his retinue. Long locks of his hair fall girlishly over his shoulders and in his left hand he holds a bunch of grapes, emblematic of his status as god of wine.

2. Title: Right hand of God. Fact: The right hand of God ("Dextera Domini" "right hand of the Lord" in Latin) or God's right hand may refer to the Bible and common speech as a metaphor for the omnipotence of God and as a motif in art.

3. Title: Hand of God (art). Fact: The Hand of God, or Manus Dei in Latin, also known as Dextera domini/dei, the "right hand of God", is a motif in Jewish and Christian art, especially of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods, when depiction of Jehovah or God the Father as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in or approval of affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art. Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention or approval of human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.

4. Title: Don Quixote (Teno). Fact: "Don Quixote" depicts a bronze and stone figure of Don Quixote wearing a full suit of armor riding his horse Rosinante which emerges from a jagged piece of stone. The jagged stone is Colmenar stone from Pamplona. Only the front portion of Don Quixote and his horse are visible. The horse appears to be charging forward out of the stone with his head raised, mouth open, and hooves kicking. The left foot of the horse is not formed, intentionally, by Teno. In Don Quixote's hand is a lance of steel. Both figures are loosely modeled and the figures and stone rest on a oval base measuring which was cut into three pieces for transport by ship to the United States.

5. Title: Bacchus (Leonardo). Fact: Bacchus, formerly Saint John the Baptist, is a painting in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, France, based on a drawing by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci. It is presumed to have been executed by an unknown follower, perhaps in Leonardo's workshop. Sydney J. Freedberg assigns the drawing to Leonardo's second Milan period. Among the Lombard painters who have been suggested as possible authors are Cesare da Sesto, Marco d'Oggiono, Francesco Melzi, and Cesare Bernazzano. The painting shows a male figure with garlanded head and leopard skin, seated in an idyllic landscape. He points with his right hand off to his left, and with his left hand grasps his thyrsus and also points down to earth.

Question: What color undershirt is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wearing?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Undershirt. Fact: An undershirt is an article of underwear worn underneath a dress shirt intended to protect it from body sweat and odors. Alternatively, it may be worn to protect the body from stiff or otherwise uncomfortable fabric that a person may be required to wear (such as a mandatory work uniform). It can have short sleeves or be sleeveless. The term most commonly refers to upper-body wear worn by males. This article of clothing typically has a low, round neckline that can be worn for athletic purposes.

2. Title: Garibaldi shirt. Fact: A Garibaldi shirt (also called "Garibaldi jacket" or "Camicia rossa") was a woman's fashion, a red wool shirt named after the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi first popularized in 1860. It was the direct ancestor of the modern women's blouse.

3. Title: Greca (clothing). Fact: The greca, or more properly the douillette, is a clerical double-breasted overcoat worn over the cassock. The greca is slightly longer than the cassock so as to entirely cover it.

4. Title: Zephyr (cloth). Fact: Zephyr or zephyr cloth is a sheer, lightweight cotton fabric, usually plain woven, used for dresses, blouses, and shirts. It may be striped or checked. It is named after Zephyr, the Greek god of the west wind.

5. Title: Witzchoura. Fact: A witzchoura (sometimes witz-chouras) was a type of mantle, pelisse, or sleeved cloak, with a large collar and, sometimes, a hood, that was particularly fashionable in the early 19th century. The term derives from the Polish word "wilczura", meaning 'wolf fur coat'. It was inspired by Polish styles, hence sometimes being described as "a la Polonaise", although it is not the same as the gown called a polonaise. Like the original hussar's pelisse, it was typically lined with fur.

Question: What color hair does Jackée Harry have?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Baldy Jack Rose. Fact: Born in Congress Poland as Jacob Rosenzweig, he grew up in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and spent much of his early life living in Bridgeport, Waterbury, and South Norwalk, Connecticut. He contracted typhoid when he was four years old, causing alopecia universalis, leaving him permanently bald and devoid of eyebrows. His appearance caused him to be "the butt of schoolmates' joke" and where he got his underworld alias.

2. Title: Red hair. Fact: Red hair (or ginger hair) occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, appearing with greater frequency (two to six percent) among people of Northern or Northwestern European ancestry and lesser frequency in other populations. It is most common in individuals homozygous for a recessive allele on chromosome 16 that produces an altered version of the MC1R protein.

3. Title: Fox McCloud. Fact: Fox McCloud is an anthropomorphic fox with orange-brown fur, with golden-brown or white highlights. He has a stereotypical bushy white-tipped tail which appears to be very short in Star Fox 64 and Command, implying that it might have been cut off at a certain point. His eyes are inconsistently shown to be either green or blue. He will occasionally wear large tanker boots over his legs when fighting on the ground.

4. Title: Jinnicky the Red Jinn. Fact: He was first introduced in "Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz" as a mysterious figure who educates Jack Pumpkinhead on the use of the Pirate Sack. Although a detailed description is included in the text, "Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz" includes no illustrations of the Red Jinn aside from a gruesome color plate that did not appear outside the first edition, in which he has massive piercings.

5. Title: Baldwin guinea pig. Fact: Baldwins are known for having skin of a rubbery texture, lots of wrinkles and large, droopy ears. They come in all colors and patterns that haired guinea pigs come in, such as Dutch, tortoiseshell, broken colors, Himalayan and selfs.

Question: What is on the wrists of Arthur Ashe?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Harry D'Amour. Fact: D'Amour is an occult detective, a private investigator who specializes in cases involving the occult. His body is marked heavily by tattoos that confer protection against evil: "Upon his instruction, Caz had attempted to commit to Harry's body every alarm system in his arsenal that was applicable to all forms of nonhuman life that Harry might encounter."

2. Title: Ionaco. Fact: The Ionaco (often stylized as I-on-a-co or I-ON-A-CO) was an electric belt developed by Gaylord Wilshire after his career in politics. It was advertised during the 1920s as a curing device but was dismissed by contemporary medical experts as quackery.

3. Title: Knuckle tattoo. Fact: A knuckle tattoo is a specific kind of tattoo that most commonly uses two groups of four-letter words or one eight-letter word. It is not necessarily a prison tattoo, as sometimes believed, but remains an unpopular form of tattoo—alongside hand tattoos in general—due to the difficulty of hiding it in situations such as a formal setting where it would be seen as crass. One of the most popular knuckle tattoos reads LOVE / HATE, made famous by Robert Mitchum's character Reverend Harry Powell in the 1955 film "The Night of the Hunter". Some people also use their knuckles to tattoo drawings and images, sometimes in groups of four, such as the four symbols of a deck of playing cards to signify good luck. Astrological symbols also make for popular designs.

4. Title: Froment's sign. Fact: To perform the test, a patient is asked to hold an object, usually a flat object such as a piece of paper, between the thumb and index finger (pinch grip). The examiner then attempts to pull the object out of the subject's hands.

5. Title: Captain George Costentenus. Fact: Captain George Costentenus or "The Greek Albanian," (April 17, 1833 - ?) was a circus performer in the late 1800s. A man who was tattooed over his entire body, he was a famous traveling attraction who claimed to have been kidnapped by Chinese Tartars and tattooed against his will. His surname was sometimes spelled as Constantenus and Constantinius. He was also known as Djordgi Konstantinus and Georgius Constantine.

2. Title: Behind the Mike (film). Fact: George Hayes is a radio announcer in New York with a propensity for his smart-aleck behavior and quick temper. During a rehearsal for the "Crunchy Munchy Hour", he gets into a heated argument with the owner of Crunchy Munchies, Cyrus Wittles. The argument ends with Hayes belting Wittles, which also ends Hayes' employment at the radio station. He is lured to the rural community of Valley Falls, where he is promised the job of manager for a local radio station, WBAM. Upon his arrival, he sees a well run station on the main street of the town, and walks in, believing it to be where he will be managing. There he meets Jane Arledge, who is the program manager for WVOX, the actual station he has walked into. Realizing his mistake, Arledge agrees to take him to WBAM, which is actually not much of a station, housed in a barn, with a single employee, Tommy Astor.

3. Title: Right at Your Door. Fact: The film opens with Brad (Rory Cochrane), an out-of-work musician, making coffee for his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack), who is still in bed. She leaves for work and Brad is left home alone. Over the radio, he hears that several suspected dirty bombs have been detonated across Los Angeles. He exits his house and sees large amounts of smoke rising from the city. Brad gets into his car and drives to the city to find Lexi. Brad tries to contact her through her cell phone, but only receives a busy signal. He soon finds that all roads now have police blockades.

4. Title: Evil Behind You. Fact: Abducted couples are victims of medical experiments that mutate their minds with supernatural abilities. As their mental capacities increase, so does the danger from something evil that is not of flesh and blood.

It was served warm in hot summer and cool in cold winter, usually to accompany desserts such as the Panettone or other Milanese delicacies.

2. Title: Panettone. Fact: Panettone (pronounced /ˌpænɪˈtoʊni/; Italian: [panetˈtoːne]) is an Italian type of sweet bread loaf originally from Milan (in Milanese dialect of the Lombard language it is called paneton, pronounced [paneˈtuŋ] or [paneˈtũː]), usually prepared and enjoyed for Christmas and New Year in Western, Southern Europe and Southeastern as well as in Latin America, the Horn of Africa, and to a lesser extent in former French, Spanish and Portuguese colonies.

3. Title: Barbarigo family. Fact: The family originated from the Istrian area (according to the tradition, their ancestral place was Muggia, near Trieste). Also according to the family legend, in 880 AD one Arrigo won a battle against Saracen pirates and returned victoriously home with the beards ("barba" in Italian) of the defeated enemies, thus originating the family name - Barbarigo - and the coat of arms, representing six beards.

Question: Does Dries Mertens have his mouth open or closed?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Drooling. Fact: Drooling, or slobbering, is the flow of saliva outside the mouth. Drooling can be caused by excess production of saliva, inability to retain saliva within the mouth (incontinence of saliva), or problems with swallowing (dysphagia or odynophagia).

2. Title: Trismus pseudocamptodactyly syndrome. Fact: Trismus Pseudocamptodactyly syndrome is a rare genetic condition. A defining feature is the inability to open the mouth completely (trismus). Other signs and symptoms include abnormally short tendons and muscles, resulting in contractures, club foot, and other musculoskeletal abnormalities.

3. Title: Ernest P. Worrell. Fact: The rubber-faced Ernest, almost always dressed in a denim vest and baseball cap, appeared at the door of an unseen and unheard but seemingly unwilling neighbor named Vern. The spots were structured in a way to allow the viewer to be "Vern", as Varney looked directly in the camera whenever Vern was addressed. Ernest's seemingly pointless conversations with Vern – which were actually a monologue due to Vern never responding – inevitably rambled around to a favorable description of the sponsor's product, followed by his signature close, "KnowhutImean?" While Vern is never shown to ever say anything, it is implied that he finds Ernest to be an unwelcome pest due to him trying to slam his door in Ernest's face on a few occasions. Vern also shakes his head "No" whenever Ernest invites him to do something. Ernest, despite having good intentions, is utterly oblivious to Vern's apparent distress regarding him and always regards Vern as his closest buddy and confidant.

4. Title: Nick Afanasiev. Fact: Afanasiev has appeared in independent films, television pilots, an episode of Animal Planet's Killer Outbreaks, and commercials for CCM Hockey Gear, Cornetto Ice Cream, and Mopar. In 2011, he starred in the Travis Fort film "". His tongue has been showcased on numerous television shows around the world. He performs tricks such as licking his elbow, licking his eye, text messaging with his tongue, and licking ice cream from the tip of his nose.

5. Title: Fred Ott. Fact: In the former film, Ott takes a pinch of snuff, which causes him to sneeze.

Question: What direction is Rodrigo De Paul wearing his hat?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Camauro. Fact: A camauro (from the Latin "camelaucum" and from the Greek "kamelauchion", meaning "camel skin hat") is a cap traditionally worn by the Pope of the Catholic Church.

2. Title: Tabarin. Fact: A contemporary woodcut shows Tabarin in the dress of a clown, but with a gallant moustache and pointed beard, carrying a wooden sword, like his distant puppet descendant Mr. Punch, — which would trip him up— and wearing a soft grey felt hat capable of assuming countless amusing shapes in his deft fingers. "Tabarin" from French "tabard" denotes a short cloak of the kind the "commedia dell'arte" figure Scaramouche wears.

3. Title: Man with Red Hat. Fact: Man with a Red Hat is a painting attributed to Italian Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio, created around 1490–1493. It is housed in the Museo Correr in Venice.

4. Title: Camino del Cid. Fact: The Camino del Cid is a cultural tourist itinerary based on historical personage Rodrigo Díaz and the literary work "El Cantar de mio Cid". In both cases they are references of international scope: El Cid, "Castilian hero par excellence, the most exalted knight of medieval Spain" and the "Cantar de mio Cid", "one of the great classics of European literature".

5. Title: Dorcon. Fact: Dorcon approaches Chloe's father to ask for her hand in marriage, trying to convince Dryas with a gift of noble cheeses. He tries to assuage his love for Chloe in a variety of ways, including one scene where he clothes himself in a wolf skin and hides in a bush. As he waits to sneak up on Chloe, he is attacked by Daphnis and Chloe's herding dogs. When Daphnis and Chloe discover the cause of commotion in the bush, they come to Dorcon's aid and assume he was playing some "pastoral trick."

Question: What type of piercing does Manuel Lazzari have?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hafada piercing. Fact: Hafada piercings are usually pierced with a captive bead ring, a curved barbell or straight barbell.

2. Title: Tembetá. Fact: A tembetá (Guaraní language: "tembé": lip, "Ita": stone.) or barbote (Argentina) is a metal or stone rod placed in lower lip piercings by members of some indigenous peoples in South America. It has been used since the Neolithic period by different human groups for body modification, spiritual protection, and indication of sexual maturity.

3. Title: Navel piercing. Fact: Unlike most surface piercings, this is one of the few that do not normally reject, although the rejection rate is higher than non-surface piercings, such as ear piercing. The actual navel is not pierced when a navel piercing is performed. The most common form of navel piercing is through the upper rim of the navel. It is worn by a lot of female celebrities including Britney Spears and Beyoncé.

4. Title: Mazzatello. Fact: Mazzatello (abbreviated mazza) was a method of capital punishment used by the Papal States from the late 18th century to 1870 involving the infliction of head trauma. The method was named after the implement used in the execution: a large, long-handled mallet or pollaxe. According to Abbott, "mazzatello" constituted "one of the most brutal methods of execution ever devised, requiring minimal skill on the part of the executioner and superhuman acquiescence by the victim". Megivern cites "mazzatello" as one example of an execution method devised by the Papal States that "competed with and in some instances surpassed those of other regimes for cruelty".

5. Title: Mirin Dajo. Fact: Arnold Gerrit Henskes (6 August 1912 – 26 May 1948), known by the pseudonym Mirin Dajo, was a Dutch performer. He became famous for radically piercing his body with all kinds of objects and apparently without injury, even astounding the medical community at the time.

Question: What is Billy Joel doing to indicate that he is happy?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Red Rubber Ball. Fact: "Red Rubber Ball" is sung from the perspective of a man who is exiting (or has recently exited) an unfulfilling relationship in which his significant other never gave him much attention or affection. He now looks forward to the future with a positive attitude.

2. Title: Malapropism. Fact: A malapropism (also called a malaprop or Dogberryism) is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, sometimes humorous utterance. An example is the statement by baseball player Yogi Berra, "Texas has a lot of electrical votes", rather than "electoral votes". Malapropisms often occur as errors in natural speech and are sometimes the subject of media attention, especially when made by politicians or other prominent individuals. Philosopher Donald Davidson has said that malapropisms show the complex process through which the brain translates thoughts into language.

3. Title: Mic drop. Fact: A mic drop is the gesture of intentionally dropping one's microphone at the end of a performance or speech to signal triumph. Figuratively, it is an expression of triumph for a successful event and indicates a boastful attitude toward one's own performance.

4. Title: O (gesture). Fact: The "O" is a gesture used predominantly at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, Oregon, United States, and at events in which the school's athletic teams, the Oregon Ducks, are taking part. The gesture, in which the forefinger and thumb of each hand are pressed together to form an "O" shape, is used to show support for the team. First used by University of Oregon band directors as a cue to indicate the song to be played, it gained its current meaning after a photograph of quarterback Joey Harrington appeared on the front page of "The Oregonian" making the "O" sign with his hands.

5. Title: Ouija. Fact: The ouija ( , ), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words "yes", "no", "hello" (occasionally), and "goodbye", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. "Ouija" was formerly a trademark belonging to Parker Brothers, and has subsequently become a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the United States, but is often used generically to refer to any talking board. According to Hasbro, players take turns asking questions and then "wait to see what the planchette spells out" for them. It is recommended for players over the age of eight.

Question: did dwyane wade won a championship his rookie year
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dwyane Wade. Fact: Selected 5th overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade quickly emerged as a productive player on a youthful Miami Heat team and averaged 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting with averages of 4.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. Wade is one of only four Marquette University players to be drafted in the first round; his is the highest draft selection in school history. After a 5-15 start, the Heat would gradually improve and finish 42-40 to qualify for the NBA playoffs. He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs, particularly against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. In the end, however, Wade's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the success of fellow rookies Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James. Wade did earn unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team, and also finished third in rookie of the year voting (behind James and Anthony). He was ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played. In the playoffs Wade hit a game-winning shot in Game 1 of the Heat's first round series against the New Orleans Hornets. The Heat won the series 4-3 and advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded and best record team in the NBA, the Indiana Pacers, in a very entertaining series that almost pushed the 61-win Pacers to the edge, though Miami would eventually lose the series in six games. He became the fourth rookie since the shot clock era began to lead his team in scoring and assist average in the postseason.

2. Title: Billy Wade (racing driver). Fact: Billy was the 1963 NASCAR Rookie of the Year for car owner Cotton Owens. He finished the season with 14 Top 10 finishes in 31 races. He won four consecutive races the following year for Bud Moore Engineering between July 10 and July 19, 1964. The four wins give Wade the sole distinction of being the only driver to accomplish this feat with victories at Old Bridge Stadium on July 10, the road course at Bridgehampton, N.Y on the 12th, a July 15 win at Islip Speedway in New York, and his fourth (and final) win at Watkins Glen. Dick Linder also followed his first victory at Dayton with a win at Hamburg; but Wade is the only driver to string four victories in a row once he got his first. He also accumulated five poles and 25 Top 10 finishes in his 35 starts. As of 2017, he is the most recent driver in NASCAR to get his first pole and win in the same weekend.

3. Title: Tristan Wade. Fact: Wade's first professional live game tournament in the money finish was 25th-place in (WSOP), for a prize of $23,735.

4. Title: Jake Wade (baseball). Fact: A native of Morehead City, North Carolina, Wade made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers in 1936 as he went 4–5. His most productive season came in 1937, when he posted career highs in wins (7), starts (25), complete games (7), strikeouts (69) and innings pitched (165-1/3).

5. Title: Terrell Wade. Fact: Wade was signed by the Atlanta Braves originally as a free agent in 1991. Wade earned a World Series ring by pitching in three games in 1995, a total of four innings. His best season as a major leaguer was 1996 in which he pitched in 44 games, going 5-0 with an ERA of 2.97.

His mother Melinda becomes his carer, with a little help from her husband, Colin. His therapist, insists the slightest nudge in the wrong direction could tip him over the edge.

"Vantage Point" also explores kidnapping, assassination and terrorism.

Knoxville was inspired to make the film after seeing Matt Robertson's 2013 short documentary "The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever", about Action Park, a theme park in New Jersey which was notorious for poorly designed, unsafe rides, in addition to employing underaged, undertrained and often under-the-influence staff.

4. Title: Trouble at Timpetill. Fact: Trouble at Timpetill  is a 2008 French fantasy adventure film written and directed by Nicolas Bary, based on the novel of the same name by Henry Winterfeld.

Question: What item with two posts is seen here in the 1978 Amco Cup?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Cavalier's Cup. Fact: At Telford Old Hall, the past is a constant reminder in the present. Long-dead Cavalier Sir Byng Rawdon still haunts the house, and lately has been making his ghostly presence known, it seems.

2. Title: TVR Wedges. Fact: The TVR Wedges are a series of wedge-shaped sports cars built by British specialist sports car manufacturer TVR between 1980 and 1991. There were 2-seat convertibles and 2-seater or 2+2 liftback coupés, with four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines from a variety of manufacturers. The name refers to their sharp-nosed angular shape, particular to the late seventies when they were designed.

3. Title: Wackel-Elvis. Fact: Wackel-Elvis (, "Wobbly Elvis") is a tall, hanging dashboard figure designed to resemble musician and actor Elvis Presley. A prototype of the figure was first introduced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi in a series of television commercials which were broadcast in several European countries. The commercials were produced by the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi in 2001 to promote Audi's new continuously variable ""multitronic"" transmission. Due to a high demand by Elvis fans after publication of the commercials, 15,000 Wackel-Elvis figures were produced and sold at the Audi factory outlet store.

4. Title: Ejector Seat. Fact: Six contestants compete for a chance to win up to £10,000 cash on each episode. They sit in armchairs mounted on parallel tracks that stretch the length of the stage. The farthest one-fourth of each track is lit up red as a "danger zone." If a contestant moves all the way through their danger zone to the end of the track, they are eliminated from the game and "ejected" by being tipped backward out of their chair amid a burst of light and dry ice smoke.

5. Title: Cog (advertisement). Fact: "Cog" is a British television and cinema advertisement launched by Honda in 2003 to promote the seventh-generation Accord line of cars. It follows the convention of a Rube Goldberg machine, utilizing a chain of colliding parts taken from a disassembled Accord. Wieden+Kennedy developed a GB£6 million marketing campaign around "Cog" and its partner pieces, "Sense" and "Everyday", broadcast later in the year. The piece itself was produced on a budget of £1 million by Partizan Midi-Minuit. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet directed the seven-month production, contracting The Mill to handle post-production. The 120-second final cut of "Cog" was broadcast on British television on 6 April 2003, during a commercial break in ITV's coverage of the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Question: How many petals are on the flower in the Brisbane rugby league team logo?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Brisbane City (rugby union). Fact: The Brisbane City team in the NRC takes its identity from the metropolitan rugby team that has represented Brisbane for more than a century. The representative team's colours and a similar logo were inherited for the NRC. The Brisbane City uniform is yellow and blue, with a crest of the City Hall logo within Queensland Rugby's traditional ‘Q’ on the jersey's chest.

2. Title: Queensland rugby league team. Fact: The Queensland rugby league team represents the Australian state of Queensland in rugby league football. Nicknamed the "Maroons", after the colour of their jersey, the team plays three times a year against arch-rivals New South Wales in the State of Origin series. Coached by Kevin Walters and captained by Daly Cherry-Evans, the team is administered by the Queensland Rugby League and plays all of its home matches at Brisbane's Lang Park (now known as Suncorp Stadium).

3. Title: Brisbane Roar FC. Fact: Brisbane competes in the country's premier competition, the A-League, and has ex Liverpool and England international player Robbie Fowler as manager.

4. Title: Flag of Brisbane. Fact: The white, wavy lines in three of the six quarters of the flag may represent the river, which brought much commerce and prosperity to the city in the early days of British settlement. An alternative explanation is that the wavy lines represent white clouds, parting to allow the blue sky to be seen behind them. The three caducei in these sections, rather than their popular but erroneous association with medicine, again represent commerce, referencing the role of Hermes in Greek mythology in his capacity as the protector of commerce and trade. The remaining three quarters depict two pretzel knots and a star, with the stars representing the achievements in astronomy of Sir Thomas Brisbane, for whom the city is named, and the knots representing the 38th Foot (Staffordshire Regiment), which Brisbane served in prior to being named governor of the colony of New South Wales. The abundance of maritime symbols on the flag reflects Brisbane's early role as a river port.

5. Title: Queensland Cup. Fact: The Queensland Cup, known as the Intrust Super Cup for sponsorship reasons, is the highest-level regional rugby league football competition in Queensland, Australia. It is run by the Queensland Rugby League (QRL) and is contested by fourteen teams, twelve of which are based in Queensland, with one based in New South Wales and one in Papua New Guinea.

Question: How many women are wearing pants in the cover of Rap-Up?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dress Suits to Hire. Fact: Described as a "lesbian noir" piece, "Dress Suits" tells all about two women, Deeluxe and Michigan, who are shacking up in the lobby of a clothing rental shop in the East Village. As the action begins, the more butch partner, Deeluxe (Peggy Shaw), slips on a pair of nylon stockings while singing a love song in a husky baritone. She wears gender roles as one might put on a shirt, seeming equally comfortable in a button-down item or a camisole. Moments later, she asphyxiates herself with her right arm, but this becomes only a minor obstacle; even death is but a costume for these women. (Incidentally, the aforementioned arm develops into its own character named "Little Peter" later in the play.). The show's heated fantasies, brassy broads and sexual charades make for a carnivorous free-for-all.

2. Title: Barely Legal (magazine). Fact: The magazine features explicit photos of naked young women, all of whom are at least 18 years old. The models are selected and photographed to emphasize their youth. The pictorials do not feature simulated or hardcore sex with men; models either appear by themselves or in groups of two or more women. In each issue, one of the models is singled out as the ""Barely Legal" Teen Queen of the Month," whose pictorial includes the centerfold.

3. Title: Koakuma Heaven. Fact: On its record jacket, "Koakuma Heaven" features a total of 15 female models, such as Sayaka Araki and Sayo Hayakawa, who have appeared in the popular gyaru magazine "Koakuma Ageha". The fanclub-only version of the jacket features Gackt dressed as a woman.

4. Title: Exotique. Fact: "Exotique" was entirely devoted to fetish fashions and female-dominant bondage fantasies. The 36 issues featured photos and illustrations of dominatrix-inspired vamps (including wife Tana Louise and iconic model Bettie Page) wearing exotic leather and rubber ensembles, corsets, stockings/garters, boots, and high heels. The articles, many written by Burtman using an alias, covered various aspects of sadomasochism and transvestism, with men depicted as slaves to imperious, all-powerful women.

5. Title: King (magazine). Fact: "King" magazine is mainly characterized by its lavish photoshoots, which usually feature scantily-clad women, often complete with an interview from the featured model. The subjects of these shoots range from professional models such as Melyssa Ford and Toccara to well-known musicians and actresses, including Trina, Keyshia Cole and Elise Neal. It also features interviews with rappers. The magazine almost exclusively uses pictures from its photoshoots as the cover of the magazine. The Lycos 50 Daily Report noted the magazine received more online searches than "Newsweek" or "Reader's Digest".

Question: which country was the first to land on the moon
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Exploration of the Moon. Fact: NASA's Apollo program was the first, and to date only, mission to successfully land humans on the Moon, which it did six times. The first landing took place in 1969, when astronauts placed scientific instruments and returned lunar samples to Earth.

2. Title: Luna 1. Fact: Luna 1, also known as Mechta ( , "lit.": "Dream"), E-1 No.4 and "First Lunar Rover", was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of the Earth's Moon, and the first spacecraft to be placed in heliocentric orbit. Intended as an impactor, "Luna 1" was launched as part of the Soviet Luna programme in 1959, however due to an incorrectly timed upper stage burn during its launch, it missed the Moon, in the process becoming the first spacecraft to leave geocentric orbit.

3. Title: Moon landing. Fact: A Moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.

4. Title: Apollo 11. Fact: Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module "Eagle" on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and they collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module "Columbia" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin "Columbia" in lunar orbit.

5. Title: First on the Moon. Fact: A group of journalists are investigating a highly secret document when they uncover a sensational story: that before the Second World War, in 1938, the first rocket was made in the USSR and Soviet scientists were planning to send an orbiter to the Moon and back. The evidence is convincing; it is clear that in this case, Soviet crewed lunar program cosmonauts were first.

Question: which song that was released under the 'Atco' label promoted a song released on the polygram tv record label?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Atco Records. Fact: ATCO Records is an American record company and label founded in 1955 as a division of Atlantic Records. It was devised as an outlet for productions by one of Atlantic's founders, Herb Abramson, who had returned to the company from military service. It was also intended as a home for acts that did not fit the format of Atlantic, which was releasing blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and soul. The Atco name is an abbreviation of ATlantic COrporation. Atco also provided distribution for other labels, including RSO Records, Volt, Island, Modern, Ruthless, Hansa Records and Rolling Stones Records.

2. Title: Private Stock Records. Fact: The label was founded by Larry Uttal after he was ousted from Bell Records. The label primarily focused on pop music and had numerous hit records, many of them one-hit wonders, including singles by David Soul of "Starsky and Hutch" fame ("Don't Give Up on Us"), Starbuck ("Moonlight Feels Right"), Austin Roberts ("Rocky"), Samantha Sang ("Emotion"), Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band ("A Fifth of Beethoven"), Cyndi Grecco ("Making Our Dreams Come True," a.k.a. the theme song to "Laverne & Shirley") and Frankie Valli ("My Eyes Adored You", "Swearin' to God", "Our Day Will Come"). The label also released Brownsville Station's album with the same name, and the singles "The Martian Boogie" and "(Lady) Put the Light on Me" in 1977. More indicative of the label's nature, Private Stock issued for the US in 1976 a compilation of Rod Stewart's work with Steampacket and the Hoochie Koochie Men culled from mid-1960s live shows in the UK while the singer was transitioning from Mercury Records to Warner Brothers. In the early 1980s a Stray Cats compilation appeared in stores, ostensibly a licensee of Capitol Records but debatable as to whether it was even the same company.

3. Title: Atco Records. Fact: For most of its history Atco was known for pop music and rock and roll, but during its early years it produced some jazz albums. These included Harry Arnold, Betty Carter, King Curtis, Herb Geller, Roland Hanna, and Helen Merrill.

4. Title: The Premier Hits. Fact: The Premier Hits is a compilation album by Gary Numan released in March 1996 on the Polygram TV record label. The album was promoted by the re-released remixed version of "Cars" ('E' Reg Model), re-titled as the 'Premier Mix' in a TV advert campaign for Carling Premier lager. The single reached No 17, making the third time that Cars has reached the official UK Top 40 charts.

5. Title: The Who Sell Out. Fact: A concept album, "The Who Sell Out" is structured as a collection of unrelated songs interspersed with fake commercials and public service announcements. The album purports to be a broadcast by pirate radio station Radio London. The reference to "selling out" was an intended irony, as the Who had been making real commercials during that period of their career, some of which are included as bonus tracks on the remastered CD.

Question: when did the blu ray player come out
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Blu-ray. Fact: The first consumer device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the Sony BDZ-S77, a $3,800 (US) BD-RE recorder that was made available only in Japan. But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were released for this player. Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with digital rights management before they would release movies for the new format, and they wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed Content Scramble System (CSS) used on DVDs. On October 4, 2004, the name "Blu-ray Disc Founders" was officially changed to the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), and 20th Century Fox joined the BDA's Board of Directors. The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in 2004.

2. Title: Sony BDP-S1. Fact: The Sony BDP-S1 is a first generation Blu-ray Disc (BD) player and is the first such player released in North America. It was originally scheduled for release in the United States on August 18, 2006 with a MSRP of $999.95. Sony had postponed the release date of this player several times and it was released on December 4, 2006.

3. Title: Blu-ray Disc Association. Fact: The "Blu-ray Disc founder group" was started on 20 May 2002 by MIT and nine leading electronic companies: Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer, Philips, Thomson, LG Electronics, Hitachi, Sharp, and Samsung Electronics.

4. Title: Paper disc. Fact: The paper disc is a digital disc format. Developed by Sony and Toppan Printing, the disc can be read by Sony's new Blu-ray Disc (BD) player and offers up to 25 GB of storage. It was announced on April 15, 2004.

Question: What Academy Award did Walter Thomas Huston won in a 1948 American dramatic adventurous neo-western?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Walter Huston. Fact: Walter Thomas Huston (/ˈwɔːltər ˈhjuːstən/; born Walter Thomas Huston; April 6, 1883 – April 7, 1950) was a Canadian-born American actor and singer. Huston won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, directed by his son John Huston. He was the grandfather of Pablo Huston, Walter Anthony (Tony) Huston, actress Anjelica Huston, Danny Huston, and Allegra Huston, as well as the great-grandfather of actor Jack Huston.

2. Title: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film). Fact: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a 1948 American dramatic adventurous neo-western written and directed by John Huston. It is a feature film adaptation of B. Traven's 1927 novel of the same name, about two financially desperate Americans, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt), who in the 1920s join old-timer Howard (Walter Huston, the director's father) in Mexico to prospect for gold.

3. Title: Harold Russell. Fact: Harold John Avery Russell (January 14, 1914 – January 29, 2002) was a Canadian-born American World War II veteran who became one of only two non-professional actors to win an Academy Award for acting (the other being Haing S. Ngor). Russell also has the distinction of being the only performer to sell his Oscar award at auction.

4. Title: 49th Academy Awards. Fact: This Academy Awards ceremony is notable for Peter Finch becoming the first posthumous winner of an Oscar for acting, a feat matched only by fellow Australian Heath Ledger 32 years later; Finch had suffered a fatal heart attack in mid-January. Beatrice Straight set another record by becoming the actor with the shortest performance ever in a film to win an acting Oscar, with only five minutes and two seconds of screen-time in "Network". "Network", along with "All the President's Men," were the two biggest champs of the ceremony with four Oscars each, but Best Picture and Best Director ultimately went to "Rocky".

5. Title: List of awards and nominations received by Jack Nicholson. Fact: The Oscars (officially called "Academy Awards") are a set of awards given annually for excellence of cinematic achievements. The awards, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), were first held in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Nicholson has received three awards from twelve nominations, the most nominations for a male performer and tied with Daniel Day-Lewis and Walter Brennan for most wins by a male performer.

Question: Confrontation at Concordia chronicles an attempt to cancel an address by the current Prime Minister of what country?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Confrontation at Concordia. Fact: Confrontation at Concordia is a documentary film by Martin Himel which documents the September 2002 protest at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. The film chronicles how pro-Palestinian student activists staged a direct action aimed to cancel the former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on campus. The talk by the prime minister had been organized by Hillel, a Jewish student organization.

2. Title: French Kiss: Stephen Harper's Blind Date with Quebec. Fact: French Kiss: Stephen Harper's Blind Date with Quebec is a non-fiction book written by Chantal Hébert, a Canadian writer and columnist for the "Toronto Star" and "Le Devoir", first published by Knopf Canada in April 2007. In the book, the author recounts the 2006 general election in the province of Quebec and the improbable dominance of the Conservative Party in that region. Hébert describes the outcome as a "combination of Harper's tactical brilliance and Paul Martin's political ineptitude." The book presents complex issues in "clear and concise" prose. Hébert's enduring quality throughout the telling is objectivity, an increasingly rare trait amongst journalists.

3. Title: October Crisis. Fact: The October Crisis  occurred in October 1970 in the province of Quebec in Canada, mainly in the Montreal metropolitan area. Members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped the provincial Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte and British diplomat James Cross. In response, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act. The kidnappers murdered Laporte and negotiations led to Cross's release and the kidnappers' exile to Cuba.

4. Title: Benjamin Netanyahu. Fact: Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu (Hebrew: בִּנְיָמִין "בִּיבִּי" נְתַנְיָהוּ (help·info); born 21 October 1949) is the current Prime Minister of Israel. Netanyahu also currently serves as a member of the Knesset and Chairman of the Likud party.

5. Title: The Negotiator (novel). Fact: In 1989, Texan oil baron Cyrus Miller and shipping tycoon Melvin Scanlon conspire to bring the oil fields of the Middle East under American control. Meanwhile, United States President John Cormack and his Soviet counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev draw up plans for a $100 billion arms reduction bill – the "Nantucket Treaty". This proves debilitating for Miller and Scanlon's plans, so they team up with three arms manufacturers who will be financially ruined by the treaty and hire mercenary Irving Moss, a sexual sadist and ex-CIA officer recently released from prison, to devise a plan to destroy the President and therefore the treaty.

As the zoos workers are conscripted and replaced by PoWs, Vera and her husband Axel fight to maintain the zoo's standards and to survive as the world about them disintegrates.

2. Title: The Zookeeper's Wife (film). Fact: The Zookeeper's Wife is a 2017 war drama film directed by Niki Caro, written by Angela Workman and based on Diane Ackerman's non-fiction book of the same name. The film tells the true story of how Jan and Antonina Żabiński rescued hundreds of Jews from the Germans by hiding them in their Warsaw zoo during World War II.[Note 1] It stars Jessica Chastain, Johan Heldenbergh, Daniel Brühl and Michael McElhatton.

3. Title: The Tiger's Wife. Fact: "The Tiger's Wife" is set in an unnamed Balkan country, spanning the mid 20th-century to the early 21st century.

4. Title: Zoo City. Fact: "Zoo City" is set in an alternate version of the South African city of Johannesburg, in which people who have committed a crime are magically attached to an animal familiar – those who receive such punishment are said to be "animalled". The novel's chief protagonist, Zinzi December, is a former journalist and recovering drug addict who was "animalled" to a sloth after getting her brother killed. She lives in the Johannesburg suburb of Hillbrow, which is nicknamed "Zoo City" in the novel for its large population of animalled people, refugees and the dispossessed. Zinzi is attempting to repay the financial debt she owes her drug dealer by charging people for her special skill of finding lost objects, as well as making use of her writing abilities by drafting 419 fraud emails. The book's plot focuses on Zinzi's attempts to find the missing female member of a brother-and-sister pop duo for a music producer, in return for the money she needs to fully repay her dealer.

Question: steven universe save the light how many players
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Steven Universe: Save the Light. Fact: Save the Light features seven playable characters from the series, Steven, Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl, Connie, Greg and Peridot, with an eighth character to be added in a future content update; four characters can be equipped to a party at a time. The game has a "blend of real-time and turn-based combat", and more of a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving more than its predecessor. Players are able to explore Beach City and surrounding areas, and engage in battles with enemies. During battle, the players' actions, which include attacking and defending, will build up the star meter which allows the characters to pull off more powerful moves. A new feature allows characters to build up a relationship-based meter during battles and dialogue interactions; when filled, characters are able to fuse, such as Steven and Connie into Stevonnie.

2. Title: Steven Universe: Attack the Light. Fact: "Attack the Light" is a simplified role-playing game in which Steven and the three Crystal Gems—Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl — travel across five color-themed worlds. Players move across the map by swiping the touchscreen and can interact with chests, mechanisms, and hidden areas to obtain items that can either be used in battle or to open up other areas. Some areas may be inaccessible until players solve a puzzle or obtain the necessary item from another level.

3. Title: Hex Heroes. Fact: Up to five players, one with the Wii U GamePad and four with Wii Remotes, harvest resources, build structures, fend off enemies, and explore dangerous territories. The player using the GamePad manages resources and teammates, makes executive decisions, and surveys the land from a bird’s-eye view. There are different classes to choose from with each playing a different role.

4. Title: Cosmic Star Heroine. Fact: "Cosmic Star Heroine" is a role-playing game where the player recruits up to 11 playable characters, and chooses a party of four to go into combat with enemies. There are no random battles; combat takes place on the field like in "Chrono Trigger", with visible enemies and bosses. These encounters do not respawn, but if a player desires to "grind" for more levels and money, they can start additional battles at any time with as a VR battle, somewhat similar to the ability in "Cthulhu Saves the World" to force an encounter. Rather than using traditional MP, a unique charge-based system is used. In battle, each character sets up to 7 abilities and a rest/defend type ability; in general, once an ability is used, it cannot be used again until the defend ability is used, which recharges all spent abilities. Additionally, each character has a specific pattern for gaining "Hyper" turns wherein their abilities are drastically more effective. This makes it so that "spamming" the most powerful ability is less effective due to needing to spend a turn resting to recharge it; the gameplay is based around setting up buffs and debuffs, then using powerful abilities on Hyper turns. Status effects also operate on a "reliable" basis, rather than having a percentage chance of success, but enemies also increase status ailment resistance after being inflicted with an ailment. Characters, both PCs and enemies, also have a Style gauge that starts at 100% and increases with most actions. Style acts as a multiplier increasing damage done. Style can be lost via near-death and death, as well as certain powerful "Burst" moves that reset Style to 100%. This acts similar to mechanics in earlier games made by Zeboyd that increase the tension and damage dealt the longer a fight persists. The game has four difficulty settings which can freely be changed between in-game; enemies are tougher and deal more damage on the higher difficult settings.

5. Title: Save New York. Fact: The game can be played by one or two players. Player one has a white airplane and player two has a blue one. In a two-player game, both airplanes are on screen at the same time. During play, aliens resembling large spiders begin to descend from the sky, flying towards the buildings. If left alone, they will eat parts of the buildings, eventually causing them to collapse. The player has to shoot the aliens to stop them from eating the buildings. When all aliens on a level have been killed, the game progresses to the next level. The player earns bonus points for each apartment still left intact.

In general, respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish. Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during non-REM sleep and in waking. The fluctuations of heart rate and arterial pressure tend to coincide with PGO waves and rapid eye movements, twitches, or sudden changes in breathing.

2. Title: Hypnopompic. Fact: The hypnopompic state (or hypnopompia) is the state of consciousness leading out of sleep, a term coined by the psychical researcher Frederic Myers. Its mirror is the hypnagogic state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is rational waking cognition trying to make sense of non-linear images and associations; the hypnopompic state is emotional and credulous dreaming cognition trying to make sense of real world stolidity. They have a different phenomenological character. Depressed frontal lobe function in the first few minutes after waking – known as "sleep inertia" – causes slowed reaction time and impaired short-term memory. Sleepers often wake confused, or speak without making sense, a phenomenon the psychologist Peter McKeller calls "hypnopompic speech". When the awakening occurs out of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, in which most dreams occur, the hypnopompic state is sometimes accompanied by lingering vivid imagery. Some of the creative insights attributed to dreams actually happen in this moment of awakening from REM. In Deirdre Barrett's "The Committee of Sleep", Margie Profet's McArthur Award-winning biology experiment is shown to be one of these.

3. Title: Paradoxical intention. Fact: In psychotherapy, paradoxical intention is the deliberate practice of a neurotic habit or thought, undertaken to identify and remove it. The concept was termed by Dr. Viktor Frankl, the founder of Logotherapy, who advocated for its use by patients experiencing severe forms of anxiety disorders.

4. Title: Pulsus paradoxus. Fact: Pulsus paradoxus, also paradoxic pulse or paradoxical pulse, is an abnormally large decrease in stroke volume, systolic blood pressure and pulse wave amplitude during inspiration. The normal fall in pressure is less than 10 mmHg. When the drop is more than 10 mmHg, it is referred to as pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus is not related to pulse rate or heart rate and it is not a paradoxical rise in systolic pressure. The normal variation of blood pressure during breathing/respiration is a decline in blood pressure during inhalation and an increase during exhalation. Pulsus paradoxus is a sign that is indicative of several conditions, including cardiac tamponade, chronic sleep apnea, croup, and obstructive lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD).

5. Title: Diaphragmatic paradox. Fact: Diaphragmatic paradox or paradoxical diaphragm phenomenon is an abnormal medical sign observed during respiration, in which the diaphragm moves opposite to the normal directions of its movements. The diaphragm normally moves downwards during inspiration and upwards during expiration. But in diaphragmatic paradox, it moves upwards during inspiration and downwards during expiration.

Question: a solar system has four earth-size terrestrial planets
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Terrestrial planet. Fact: The Solar System has four terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Only one terrestrial planet, Earth, is known to have an active hydrosphere.

2. Title: Solar System. Fact: The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

3. Title: Giant planet. Fact: A giant planet is any massive planet. They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist. There are four known giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.

4. Title: Solar System. Fact: The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.

5. Title: Classical planet. Fact: The term "planet" in modern terminology is only applied to natural satellites directly orbiting the Sun, so that of the seven classical planets, five are planets in the modern sense.

Question: What ancient kingdom built several temples to the Egyptian god Amun in what is now Sudan and South Sudan?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Kawa (Sudan). Fact: Kawa is a site in Sudan, located between the Third and Fourth Cataracts of the Nile on the east bank of the river, across from Dongola. In ancient times it was the site of several temples to the Egyptian god Amun, built by the Egyptian rulers Amenhotep III and Tutankhamun, and by Taharqa and other Kushite kings.

2. Title: Aksha, Sudan. Fact: Aksha is an ancient Egyptian temple, rebuilt in part at the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum. The temple was built around 1250 BC by Ramses II. It is situated in the far north of present-day Sudan, a few kilometers south of Faras, on the west side of the Nile. On the temple walls, several sacrifices are depicted. The location of the temple was not well chosen, as it is only a few inches above the high tide of the Nile. This resulted in penetration of the lower wall layers, salt crystallization on the wall surfaces, and stones being worn down over the centuries. In addition, the temple was preyed upon by the local population. Other finds at the site include cemeteries, parts of Qubanstele, and the stele with the "blessings of Ptah".

3. Title: Abu Simbel temples. Fact: The Abu Simbel temples are two massive rock temples at Abu Simbel , a village in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about southwest of Aswan (about by road). The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments", which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king and his queen Nefertari, and commemorate his victory at the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief figures have become iconic.

4. Title: Kingdom of Kush. Fact: The Kingdom of Kush or Kush (/kʊʃ, kʌʃ/) was an ancient kingdom in Nubia, located at the confluences of the Blue Nile, White Nile and River Atbara in what is now Sudan and South Sudan.

5. Title: Karnak. Fact: The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (, from Arabic "Khurnak" meaning "fortified village"), comprises a vast mix of decayed temples, chapels, pylons, and other buildings near Luxor, in Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I in the Middle Kingdom and continued into the Ptolemaic period, although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian "Ipet-isut" ("The Most Selected of Places") and the main place of worship of the eighteenth dynasty Theban Triad with the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes. The Karnak complex gives its name to the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, north of Luxor.

It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and a thin light structure. The Air is available with a screen size of (measured diagonally) 13.3in (33.782 cm), with different specifications produced by Apple. Since 2011, all MacBook Air models have used solid-state drive storage and Intel Core i5 or i7 CPUs. A MacBook Air with an 11.6in (29.46 cm) screen was made available in 2010.

2. Title: MacBook Pro. Fact: The MacBook Pro (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as MBP) is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006, by Apple Inc.

Question: who did the cardinals trade to get jim edmonds
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jim Edmonds. Fact: Edmonds was traded from Anaheim to St. Louis for second baseman Adam Kennedy and pitcher Kent Bottenfield shortly before the beginning of the 2000 season.

2. Title: Mike Caruso. Fact: Caruso was a prospect for the San Francisco Giants. During the season, Caruso was one of six prospects (along with Keith Foulke, Bob Howry, Lorenzo Barceló, Ken Vining, and Brian Manning) traded to the White Sox in exchange for Wilson Álvarez, Danny Darwin, and Roberto Hernández in what became known as the White Flag Trade.

3. Title: Lou Cordileone. Fact: Cordileone is best-known for being traded in 1961 from the New York Giants to the San Francisco 49ers for quarterback Y. A. Tittle. At the time, Tittle was 34 years old and a 4-time Pro Bowler. Cordileone was quoted as reacting "Me, even up for Y. A. Tittle? You're kidding", and later remarked that the Giants traded him for "a 42-year-old quarterback".

4. Title: Ricky Williams trade. Fact: The Ricky Williams trade was a trade between the New Orleans Saints and Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL), which occurred prior to the 1999 NFL draft. Mike Ditka of the Saints wanted to move up in the draft order to ensure that he would be able to select Ricky Williams from the University of Texas at Austin. To do so, he traded every pick he had in the draft for the fifth overall selection, which he used to select Williams.

5. Title: White Flag Trade. Fact: The White Flag Trade was a trade made between two Major League Baseball teams in 1997. On July 31, 1997, the Chicago White Sox traded three major players to the San Francisco Giants for six minor leaguers. At the time, the trade was maligned by the vast majority of White Sox fans as Jerry Reinsdorf giving up on the team, as they were only games behind the Cleveland Indians for the American League Central Division lead. "Anyone who thinks we can catch Cleveland is crazy," stated Reinsdorf. In 2000, however, the White Sox won the Central Division title, receiving large contributions from two of the players received in this trade (Keith Foulke and Bob Howry).

The player-character is a Vault-dweller in Vault 101 who is forced to flee when the Overseer tries to arrest them in response to their father leaving the Vault. Once free, the player is dubbed the Lone Wanderer and ventures into the Wasteland in and around Washington, D.C., known as the Capital Wasteland, to find their father. It differs from previous games in the series by utilizing 3D graphics, a free-roam gaming world, and real-time combat, in contrast to previous games' 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat. It was developed simultaneously for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 using the Gamebryo engine. It received highly positive reviews, garnering 94/100, 92/100, and 93/100 averages scores on Metacritic for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, respectively.

2. Title: Fallout 3.

The main story takes place in the year 2277, around 36 years after the events of "Fallout 2", of which it is not a direct sequel. Players take control of an inhabitant of Vault 101, one of several underground shelters created before the Great War to protect around 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout, who is forced to venture out into the Capital Wasteland to find their father after he disappears from the Vault under mysterious circumstances.

4. Title: Fallout 2.

Question: which beatle leads the way on the abbey road album
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: A Walk Down Abbey Road. Fact: The first set included all band members assembled to play each other's hits. The second set featured all Beatles songs performed by various band members depending on the specific tune and the strength and style of the performer.

2. Title: Abbey Road. Fact: In the image selected by McCartney, the group walk across the street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and out of step with the other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530[nb 5] and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911 – 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.

3. Title: The Abbey Road E.P.. Fact: The only "new" track is a cover of the song "Fire" by Jimi Hendrix, which was recorded during the sessions for "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan" and included in a different mix as the b-side to "Fight Like a Brave". The same recording of "Fire", however, would be later included once again on the band's next studio album "Mother's Milk" in tribute to Hillel Slovak, the band's original guitarist who died of a heroin overdose and plays guitar on the track.

4. Title: Rebel Road. Fact: The Edgar Winter Band on this album consists of Edgar Winter (vocals, saxophone, piano, organ, synthesizer and percussion), Doug "Douge Rapps" Rappoport (guitar and vocals), Koko Powell (bass and vocals), and Jimmy Paxson (drums). Winter dedicated "The Closer I Get" to his wife, Monique Winter, and "Peace and Love" to Ringo Starr.

5. Title: Lead the Way. Fact: T.W.D.Y. is composed of Ant Banks, Dolla Will and Captain Save 'Em. Ant Banks also performs drums and keyboards on the album.

Question: What is Stevie Wonder wearing over his eyes?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Stevie Boi. Fact: Stevie Boi is an American fashion designer and founder of the luxury eyewear line SB Shades. He currently resides in Baltimore.

2. Title: Thriller jacket. Fact: The red jacket worn by Michael Jackson in the "Michael Jackson's Thriller" video in 1983 has been referred to as the "Thriller" jacket. Designed by Deborah Nadoolman Landis, the candy-apple-red jacket, with black strips, was noted for its many zips, its "M" logo and Star Trek-esque angular, rigid shoulder design. The jacket became the "hottest outerwear fad of the mid-1980s" and was widely emulated. Because counterfeit copies of the jacket could sell at over $500, in 1984 Jackson filed a lawsuit in New York City to prevent unauthorized copies of the jacket and his other merchandise. On June 27, 2011, the jacket sold for $1.8 million at Julien's Auctions. The buyer, Milton Verret, described the jacket as "the greatest piece of rock and roll memorabilia in history". The proceeds from the jacket were donated to the Shambala Animal Kingdom, where Jackson's Bengal tigers were housed when he left Neverland Ranch in 2006.

3. Title: Alain Mikli. Fact: Alain Mikli (born "Alain Miklitarian", 1 April 1955) is a French-Armenian designer of high-end handmade eyeglasses and accessories. Mikli's line features unique colors and shapes, and are a favorite among European celebrities and avant-garde Americans. Mikli claims his use of color is inspired by his Lebanese Armenian heritage.

4. Title: Groucho glasses. Fact: Groucho glasses, also known as nose glasses or the beaglepuss, are a humorous novelty disguise which function as a caricature of the stage makeup used by the comedian Groucho Marx in his movies and vaudeville performances. They typically consist of black frames (either round or horn-rimmed) with attached features including bushy eyebrows, a large plastic nose, bushy moustache, and sometimes a plastic cigar. Considered one of the most iconic and widely used of all novelty items in the world, Groucho glasses were first marketed in the early 1940s and are instantly recognizable to people throughout the world. Although wearing the disguise is highly unlikely to fool friends, they often inspire laughter, and are today are often used as a shorthand for slapstick.

5. Title: Deely bobber. Fact: A deely bobber (also deeley bobber, or deeley bopper) is a novelty item of headgear comprising a headband to which are affixed two springy protrusions resembling the antennae of insects or of stereotypical little green men. These "antennae" may be topped with simple plastic shapes or more elaborate and fanciful decorations, such as mini pom poms or light-emitting diodes. The name "deely bobber" is a genericized trademark; other names include deely-boppers, bonce boppers, or space boppers. In June 1982, a "New York Times" headline called them Martian antennae.

Question: Targe (from Old Franconian *"targa " "shield", Proto-Germanic *"targo " "border") was a general word for shield in late Old English, its diminutive, "target", came to mean an object to be aimed at in the 18th century, Frankish,  Old Franconian or Old Frankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between which type span?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Targe. Fact: Targe (from Old Franconian *targa "shield", Proto-Germanic *targo "border") was a general word for shield in late Old English. Its diminutive, target, came to mean an object to be aimed at in the 18th century.

2. Title: Frankish language. Fact: Frankish (reconstructed Frankish: *Frenkisk), Old Franconian or Old Frankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between the 4th and 8th century. The language itself is poorly attested, but it gave rise to numerous loanwords in Old French. Old Dutch is the term for the Old Franconian dialects spoken in the Low Countries, i.e. in present-day Belgium, in the present Netherlands and Western parts of today's Germany until about the 12th century when it evolved into Middle Dutch.

3. Title: Clovis (given name). Fact: Clovis is the modern conventional French (and thence English) form of the Old Frankish name *"Hlōdowik" "famous in battle" (Old High German: "Chlodowig") equivalent to the modern forms Louis (French), Lodewijk (Dutch), Lewis (English), and Ludwig (German).

4. Title: Chlothar. Fact: Chlothar (Latin "Chlotharius"; French "Clotaire") is a Germanic given name, which evolved into the later form Lothair ("Lotharius"). It means "famous warrior", as a combination of the words "hlut" (loud, i.e. lauded, famous) and "heri" (army, warrior).

5. Title: Seax. Fact: Seax (; also "sax, sæx, sex"; invariant in plural, latinized "sachsum") is an Old English word for "knife". In modern archaeology, the term "seax" is used specifically for a type of small sword, knife or dagger typical of the Germanic peoples of the Migration period and the Early Middle Ages, especially the Saxons, whose name derives from the weapon. These vary considerably in size, but are mostly all-purpose tools and weapons, often carried by women as well as men.



Answer the following question: 'Targe (from Old Franconian *"targa " "shield", Proto-Germanic *"targo " "border") was a general word for shield in late Old English, its diminutive, "target", came to mean an object to be aimed at in the 18th century, Frankish,  Old Franconian or Old Frankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between which type span?'

Question: shield volcanoes tend to erupt what type of lava
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shield volcano. Fact: A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid (low viscosity) lava they erupt which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava.

2. Title: List of shield volcanoes. Fact: Shield Volcanoes are one of the three types of volcanoes. They have a short cone shape, and have basaltic lava which means the lava has low viscosity (viscosity is a measure of the ability for a liquid to flow)

3. Title: Types of volcanic eruptions. Fact: There are three different types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which is driven by the superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.

4. Title: Pyroclastic shield. Fact: In volcanology, a pyroclastic shield or ignimbrite shield is an uncommon type of shield volcano. Unlike most shield volcanoes, pyroclastic shields are formed mostly of pyroclastic and highly explosive eruptions rather than relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano.

5. Title: Pyroclastic shield. Fact: They typically display low-angle flank slopes and often have a central caldera caused by large eruptions. Lava is commonly extruded after explosive activity has ended. The paucity of associated Plinian fall deposits indicates that pyroclastic shields are characterized by low Plinian columns.

Question: How many people are displayed on this poster for 28 Days Later?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 18 Days (film). Fact: A group of ten directors, twenty or so actors, six writers, eight directors of photography, eight sound engineers, five set designers, three costume designers, seven editors, three post-production companies, and about ten technicians have agreed to act fast and shoot, with no budget and on a voluntary basis, ten short films about the January 25 revolution in Egypt. Ten stories they have experienced, heard or imagined.

2. Title: Barack Obama &quot;Joker&quot; poster. Fact: Described by "The Guardian" as the "American right's first successful use of street art", since April 2009, the poster was frequently used by anti-Obama protesters.

3. Title: Affiche Rouge. Fact: The Affiche Rouge (Red Poster) is a famous propaganda poster, distributed by Vichy France and German authorities in the spring of 1944 in occupied Paris, to discredit 23 French Resistance fighters, members of the Manouchian Group. The term Affiche Rouge also refers more broadly to the circumstances surrounding the poster's creation and distribution, the capture, trial and execution of these members of the Manouchian Group.

4. Title: Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. Fact: The design was created in one day and printed first as a street poster. It was then more widely distributed—both as a digital image and other paraphernalia—during the 2008 election season, initially independent of, but with the approval from, the official Obama campaign. The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led "The Guardian's" Laura Barton to proclaim that the image "acquired the kind of instant recognition of Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster, and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come."

5. Title: Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.) / Let MOMA Know. Fact: The event's acronym, W.A.V.E., is a nod to Flag Day, which is observed on June 14 in the United States. 400 demonstrators, wearing suffragette yellow and white, marched in front the entrance to MoMA's newly expanded 53rd street building; a well received renovation that doubled its gallery space and increased traffic to the museum. Demonstrators had three demands: that MoMA exhibit works by women artists from their permanent collection, that it display women's work in loaned exhibitions, and that it create a policy to acquire women's work in the future. The WCA created pins to parody MoMA's "Museum of Modern Art OPENS" staff badges, upon which they included the addition "But Not to Women Artists." Cards were distributed listing the names of 100 well known female artists who were not featured in the exhibit, including Alice Neel, Louise Nevelson, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Faith Ringgold and Louise Bourgeois.

Question: In the early years of "Saturday Night Live" an archetypal samurai was portrayed by an American comedian best known for what?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Saturday Night Live Samurai. Fact: In the early years of Saturday Night Live, John Belushi portrayed an archetypal samurai — he had a dedicated concept of honor, spoke only (mock) Japanese, and wielded a katana. Sketches featuring the character showed him in different occupations that would not be expected for a samurai. He always performed his tasks perfectly, despite scaring his clients quite a few times. The character was modeled after Toshiro Mifune's character in Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo.

2. Title: John Belushi. Fact: John Adam Belushi (/bəˈluːʃi/; January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor and musician. Belushi is best known for his "intense energy and raucous attitude" which he displayed as one of the seven original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's The Second City comedy club.

3. Title: Damon Wayans. Fact: Damon Kyle Wayans Sr. (; born September 4, 1960) is an American comedian, actor, writer, and producer, and member of the Wayans family of entertainers. Wayans performed as a comedian and actor throughout the 1980s, including a year long stint on the sketch comedy series "Saturday Night Live."

4. Title: Andy Kaufman. Fact: Andrew Geoffrey Kaufman (; January 17, 1949 – May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, actor, writer, wrestler and performance artist. While often called a comedian, Kaufman described himself instead as a "song and dance man". He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in a rare introspective interview, "I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ... The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can."

5. Title: Danny Thomas. Fact: Danny Thomas (born Amos Muzyad Yaqoob Kairouz; January 6, 1912 – February 6, 1991) was an American nightclub comedian, singer, actor, producer, and philanthropist whose career spanned five decades. He created and starred in one of the most successful and long-running situation comedies in the history of American network television, the eponymous "Danny Thomas Show". In addition to guest roles on many of the comedy, talk, and musical variety programs of his time, his legacy includes a lifelong dedication to fundraising for charity.

Question: what made up the three tiers of the japanese political system around 1600
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Edo society. Fact: The Tokugawa government intentionally created a social order called the Four divisions of society (shinōkōshō), that would stabilize the country. This system was based on the ideas of Confucianism that spread to Japan from China. By this system, society was composed of samurai (侍 shi), farming peasants (農 nō), artisans (工 kō) and merchants (商 shō). Samurai were placed at the top of society because they started an order and set a high moral example for others to follow. The system was meant to reinforce their position of power in society by justifying their ruling status. Peasants came second because they produced the most important commodity, food. According to Confucian philosophy, society could not survive without agriculture.:45 Third were artisans because they produced nonessential goods.

2. Title: House of Peers (Japan). Fact: In 1869, under the new Meiji government, a Japanese peerage was created by an Imperial decree merging the former Court nobility "(kuge)" and former feudal lords ("daimyōs") into a single new aristocratic class called the "kazoku." A second imperial ordinance in 1884 grouped the "kazoku" into five ranks equivalent to the European aristocrats, prince (or duke), marquis, count, viscount, and baron. Although this grouping idea was taken from the European peerage, the Japanese titles were taken from Chinese and based on the ancient feudal system in China. Itō Hirobumi and the other Meiji leaders deliberately modeled the chamber on the British House of Lords, as a counterweight to the popularly elected House of Representatives ("Shūgiin").

3. Title: Administrative structure of the Imperial Japanese Government. Fact: The main organ of the central government was the Cabinet ("naikaku"), which consisted of the Prime Minister or Premier ("naikaku sōri-daijin") and, before 1947, 12 to 14 Ministers of State, each heading a ministry (department). Under each Minister of State were two Vice-Ministers, a Permanent Vice-Minister responsible for administration and a Parliamentary Vice-Minister responsible for representing the ministry in the Diet. Each Parliamentary Vice-Minister was assisted by a Parliamentary Councillor. Each ministry comprised several bureaux, each headed by a director who oversaw several bureau sections. Each section was headed by a section chief.

4. Title: Politics of the Joseon dynasty. Fact: The political system of this period was dominated by a Confucianist bureaucracy. The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (jeong-il-pum, Hangul: 정1품, Hanja: 正一品) down to junior ninth rank (jong-gu-pum, 종9품, 從九品) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations.

5. Title: Kamakura shogunate. Fact: The Kamakura shogunate (Japanese: 鎌倉幕府, "Kamakura bakufu") was a Japanese feudal military government of imperial-aristocratic rule that ruled from 1185 to 1333. The heads of the government were the "shōguns". The first three were members of the Minamoto clan. The next two were members of the Fujiwara clan. The last six were minor Imperial princes.

Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oakleigh Park railway station. Fact: Oyster pay as you go can now be used to and from this station as well as on the majority of National Rail services in Greater London. Customers should touch in and touch out at the validators provided to ensure they are charged the correct fare.

2. Title: Epsom railway station. Fact: Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).

3. Title: New Barnet railway station. Fact: Oyster card pay-as-you-go can now be used to and from this station as well as on the majority of National Rail services in Greater London. Customers should touch in and touch out at the validators provided to ensure they are charged the correct fare.

4. Title: Oyster card. Fact: The Oyster card is a payment method for public transport in London (and certain areas around it) in the United Kingdom. A standard Oyster card is a blue credit-card-sized stored-value contact-less smart-card. It is promoted by Transport for London and can be used on travel modes across London including London Underground, London Buses, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground, Tramlink, some river boat services, and most National Rail services within the London fare zones. Since its introduction in June 2003, more than 86 million cards have been used.

5. Title: Oyster card. Fact: Oyster cards can hold period tickets; travel permits and; most commonly, credit for travel ("Pay as you go"), which must be added to the card before travel. Passengers touch it on an electronic reader when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds from the stored credit. Cards may be "topped-up" by recurring payment authority, by online purchase, at credit card terminals or by cash, the last two methods at stations or ticket offices. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of paper tickets. Usage is encouraged by offering substantially cheaper fares than with cash though the acceptance of cash is being phased out. On London buses, cash is no longer accepted.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Nightmare Before Christmas. Fact: The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Burton began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney released the film through Touchstone Pictures because the studio believed the film would be "too dark and scary for kids".

2. Title: The Night Before Christmas (1933 film). Fact: The Night Before Christmas, also known as Santa's Toys, is a 1933 American pre-Code animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists.

Composed by Danny Elfman, the soundtrack was nominated for the 1993 Golden Globe for Best Original Score. The album peaked at #64 on the US "Billboard" 200. For the film's 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, a bonus disc which contained covers of five of the film's songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks (six on the Best Buy exclusive) by Elfman were also included.

4. Title: The Night Before Christmas (1933 film). Fact: In a loose adaptation of Clement C. Moore's famous poem, St. Nick is seen delivering the toys that he made in Disney's "Santa's Workshop" (1932) to a house full of sleeping children. The toys come alive, and they dance around and have fun. The kids awake to find a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of toys.

5. Title: A Monster Christmas. Fact: A Monster Christmas or Abominable Christmas is a 2012 animated children's film, made for television.

Question: What facial expression does Adele have on her face?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Facial expression. Fact: A facial expression is one or more motions or positions of the muscles beneath the skin of the face. According to one set of controversial theories, these movements convey the emotional state of an individual to observers. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social information between humans, but they also occur in most other mammals and some other animal species. (For a discussion of the controversies on these claims, see Fridlund and Russell & Fernandez Dols.)

2. Title: Avarice (Dürer, Vienna). Fact: Intended to represent both avarice and the passing nature of youthful beauty, the woman is shown in half-length, painted in thick impasto. She has long straight blond hair, glazed eyes, a long nose, a pinched jaw and a mouth with only two remaining teeth, which is twisted in a scornful laugh. Her visible right arm is muscular and out of proportion to the rest of her body, while a dark tuft of hair sprouts from her underarm. Only her hair and the regular and almost noble outlines of her face hint at former beauty. The intense focus of the image is achieved by tight cropping and the contrasting of the lush colouring of the woman's gown and hair against a flat black background.

3. Title: Facial muscles. Fact: The facial muscles are just under the skin (subcutaneous) muscles that control facial expression. They generally originate from the surface of the skull bone (rarely the fascia), and insert on the skin of the face. When they contract, the skin moves. These muscles also cause wrinkles at right angles to the muscles’ action line.

4. Title: Salem Mitchell. Fact: Salem Mitchell (born 1998) is an American model. She is known for her numerous facial freckles. Mitchell was discovered through Instagram and is currently signed to LA Ford Models.

5. Title: Mentalis. Fact: In conjunction with orbicularis contraction, the mentalis muscle allows the lips to "pout". Externally, mentalis contraction causes wrinkling of the chin skin, as used in expressions of doubt or displeasure. It is sometimes referred to as the "pouting muscle".

Question: who played gale sayers in brian's song
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Brian's Song (2001 film). Fact: Brian's Song is the 2001 remake of the 1971 television film "Brian's Song", telling the story of Brian Piccolo (Sean Maher), a white running back who meets, clashes with and befriends fellow Chicago Bears running back Gale Sayers (Mekhi Phifer). The movie was adapted from Sayers' own words in his autobiography, "I am Third". The television movie, produced by Columbia TriStar Television, was first broadcast in the US on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC.

2. Title: Brian's Song. Fact: Brian's Song is a 1971 ABC Movie of the Week that recounts the details of the life of Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan), a Wake Forest University football player stricken with terminal cancer after turning pro, told through his friendship with Chicago Bears teammate Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams). Piccolo's and Sayers's sharply differing temperaments and racial backgrounds made them unlikely to become as close friends as they did, including becoming the first interracial roommates in the history of the National Football League, and the film chronicles the evolution of their friendship. The production was such a success on ABC that it was later shown in theaters by Columbia Pictures with a major premiere in Chicago; however, it was soon withdrawn due to a lack of business. Critics have called the movie one of the finest telefilms ever made. A 2005 readers poll taken by Entertainment Weekly ranked 'Brian's Song' seventh in its list of the top "guy-cry" films ever made.

3. Title: Brian's Song (2001 film). Fact: In the movie, Piccolo is a brash rookie with the Bears. Initially thinking Sayers is arrogant – when he is only quiet and a slight bit anti-social – they rub each other the wrong way from the moment they meet. The movie, taking place from 1965 to 1970, as the Civil Rights Movement grows, places great emphasis on integration, bringing up the conflict of when Brian and Gale room together for their first football season.

4. Title: Brian Song. Fact: The song, which charts the growth of the Brian character to manhood, was composed by Andre Jacquemin and Dave Howman with lyrics by Michael Palin. It was performed by sixteen-year-old Sonia Jones with a string and brass accompaniment in the style of a John Barry film theme (the entire brass section was performed via extensive multitracking by John Du Prez). It is included on the "Monty Python's Life of Brian" album and on the CD "Monty Python Sings". In 2013 Martin Chilton, the Culture Editor for "The Telegraph" website, listed it as one of the five best Monty Python songs.

5. Title: Brian Sings and Swings. Fact: The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Chuck Klein and Zac Moncrief. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. The episode featured guest performances by Mark Borchardt, James Burkholder, Don LaFontaine, Mike Schank, Stacey Scowley, Frank Sinatra Jr., Nicole Sullivan, Fred Tatasciore, Audrey Wasilewski, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.

Question: who sang i never promised you a rose garden
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song). Fact: "Rose Garden" (also known and covered as "(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden") is a song written by Joe South, best known as recorded by country music singer Lynn Anderson, and first released by Billy Joe Royal in 1967. Her October 1970 release topped the U.S. Billboard country chart for five weeks, reached No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, and hit number one on both Cash Box's and Record World's pop and country singles charts. The song was also a major pop hit internationally, topping the charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, and Norway, and reaching the top three in the UK and South Africa.

2. Title: I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel). Fact: I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1964) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Joanne Greenberg, written under the pen name of Hannah Green. It served as the basis for a film in 1977 and a play in 2004.

3. Title: I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (film). Fact: I Never Promised You a Rose Garden is a 1977 American fantasy drama film based on the Joanne Greenberg novel of the same name. Mel Gibson makes his film debut in a small uncredited role as a baseball player, and the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo appear as residents of Deborah's secret kingdom.

4. Title: Joanne Greenberg. Fact: Joanne Greenberg (born September 24, 1932 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American author best known for the bestselling novel "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden", written under the pen name of Hannah Green. It was adapted into a 1977 movie and a 2004 play of the same name.

5. Title: I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (play). Fact: The play was written by Colorado playwright Walter L. Newton with full cooperation of the book's author Joanne Greenberg. It was directed by Rick Bernstein, and premiered at Miners Alley Playhouse in Golden, Colorado to positive reviews in both "Variety" and "The Denver Post". The play expanded on the original story by including new information about Dr. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann from Gail Hornstein's autobiography "To Redeem One Person Is To Redeem The World". The play also restored the anti-Semitic and Jewish elements of the book that were removed from the film. "Variety" said "…the dramatic arc is a compelling mix of personal, familial and professional themes that represents the actual events in a way the 1977 film does not. Newton's coup de grace, a multilayered denouement in which the fortunes of Deborah and Dr. Fried reverse, is an especially imaginative piece of writing".

Question: What length of hair does My Church have, short or long?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Historical Christian hairstyles. Fact: The paintings in the catacombs permit the belief that the early Christians simply followed the fashion of their time. The short hair of the men and the braids of the women were, towards the end of the second century, curled, and arranged in tiers, while for women the hair twined about the head over the brow. Particular locks were reserved to fall over the forehead and upon the temples.

2. Title: Short hair. Fact: Short hair refers to any haircut with little length. It may vary from above the ears to below the chin. If a man's hair reaches the chin, it may not be considered short. For a woman, however, short varies from close-cropped to just above the shoulders. Different styles of short hair include the bob cut, the crop and the pixie cut.

3. Title: God Loves Hair. Fact: The stories in "God Loves Hair" are:

4. Title: Epitrachelion. Fact: The epitrachelion ( "around the neck"; Slavic: епитрахиль, "epitrachil"; often called simply a "stole" in casual English-language usage) is the liturgical vestment worn by priests and bishops of the Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches as the symbol of their priesthood, corresponding to the Western stole. It is essentially the "orarion" adapted for priests and bishops, worn around the neck with the two ends hanging down equally in front (more or less to the ankle) and with the two adjacent sides sewn or buttoned together up the center, leaving enough space through which to place the head. In practice, the "epitrachelion" is made to be worn only this way, tailored to lie flat around the neck, and is never actually unfastened. The portion hanging down in front is sometimes even a solid piece of fabric. It is usually made of brocade with seven embroidered or appliquéd crosses, one at the back of the neck and three down each side. The "epitrachelion" is the only required vestment whenever a priest is conducting an Orthodox service; without it, he is unable to perform the service.

5. Title: Phelonion. Fact: The phelónion (Greek: (plural, , "phailónia"; Latin paenula) is a liturgical vestment worn by a priest of the Eastern Christian tradition. It is worn over the priest's other vestments and is equivalent to the chasuble of Western Christianity.

Question: What color is the background of the I Told You So (Randy Travis song) poster?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Aw Cmon. Fact: The sleeve is a painting by Wayne White a childhood friend of Kurt Wagner who also provided cover art for "Thriller", "Nixon", and "No You Cmon" by the band.

2. Title: Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. Fact: The Barack Obama "Hope" poster is an image of Barack Obama designed by artist Shepard Fairey, which was widely described as iconic and came to represent his 2008 presidential campaign. It consists of a stylized stencil portrait of Obama in solid red, beige and (light and dark) blue, with the word "progress", "hope" or "change" below (and other words in some versions).

3. Title: Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. Fact: The design was created in one day and printed first as a street poster. It was then more widely distributed—both as a digital image and other paraphernalia—during the 2008 election season, initially independent of, but with the approval from, the official Obama campaign. The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led "The Guardian's" Laura Barton to proclaim that the image "acquired the kind of instant recognition of Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster, and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come."

4. Title: And babies. Fact: And babies (December 26, 1969) is an iconic anti-Vietnam War poster. It is a famous example of "propaganda art" from the Vietnam War that uses the now infamous color photograph of the My Lai Massacre taken by U.S. combat photographer Ronald L. Haeberle on March 16, 1968. It shows about a dozen dead and partly naked South Vietnamese women and babies in contorted positions stacked together on a dirt road, killed by U.S. forces. The picture is overlaid in semi-transparent blood-red lettering that asks along the top "Q. And babies?", and at the bottom answers "A. And babies." The quote is from a Mike Wallace CBS News television interview with U.S. soldier Paul Meadlo, who participated in the massacre. The lettering was sourced from "The New York Times", which printed a transcript of the Meadlo interview the day after.

5. Title: New Idols. Fact: The front cover is a painting by Kate Jackson of Diana Dors in Yield to the Night.

Question: Which professor from the University of Notre Dame also wrote a book which re-kindled serious philosophical debate on the existence of God?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God. Fact: The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God  is a book by Immanuel Kant, published in 1763, in the earlier period of his philosophy which he later saw as "dogmatic slumber".

2. Title: God and Other Minds. Fact: God and Other Minds is the title of a 1967 book by the American philosopher of religion Alvin Plantinga which re-kindled serious philosophical debate on the existence of God in Anglo-American philosophical circles by arguing that belief in God was like belief in other minds: although neither could be demonstrated conclusively against a determined sceptic both were fundamentally rational. Though Plantinga later modified some of his views, particularly on the soundness of the ontological argument and on the nature of epistemic rationality, he still stands by the basic theses of the book.

3. Title: Alvin Plantinga. Fact: Alvin Carl Plantinga (/ˈplæntɪŋɡə/; born November 15, 1932) is an American analytic philosopher who works primarily in logic, justification, philosophy of religion, and epistemology. From 1963 to 1982, Plantinga taught at Calvin College before accepting an appointment as the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He later returned to Calvin College to become the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy.

4. Title: Jacques Maritain. Fact: Jacques Maritain (; 18 November 1882 – 28 April 1973) was a French Catholic philosopher. Raised Protestant, he was agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books, he helped to revive Thomas Aquinas for modern times, and was influential in the development and drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pope Paul VI presented his "Message to Men of Thought and of Science" at the close of Vatican II to Maritain, his long-time friend and mentor. The same pope had seriously considered making him a lay Cardinal, but Maritain rejected it. Maritain's interest and works spanned many aspects of philosophy, including aesthetics, political theory, philosophy of science, metaphysics, the nature of education, liturgy and ecclesiology.

5. Title: Paul Tillich. Fact: Paul Johannes Tillich (August 20, 1886 – October 22, 1965) was a German-American Christian existentialist philosopher and Lutheran Protestant theologian who is widely regarded as one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century. He also wrote several Christian-themed historical works.

Question: does hermione die in the winter's tale
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Winter's Tale. Fact: Furious at their escape, Leontes now publicly accuses his wife of infidelity, and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends two of his lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to the Oracle at Delphos for what he is sure will be confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, in the hopes that the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, Camillo is an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother.

Question: What item is positioned directly in front of Michael Laudrup?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Statue of Anders Sandøe Ørsted. Fact: The monument consists of a bronze sculpture standing on a granite plinth and measures . Ørsted is depicted as an ancient wise man, sitting on a klismos and wearing a toga. He is shown in a moment of quiet contemplation, resting his left arm on the back of the chair and his chin against his hand. Under the chair stands a casket with scrolls. The casket is decorated with a relief depicting the scene where "Memesis reads the deeds of man aloud to Jupiter" ("Nemesis oplæser menneskenes gerninger for Jupiter").

2. Title: Odalisque with Raised Arms. Fact: The subject of the painting is a woman sitting in a green and yellow striped armchair. Her figure and the chair take up the majority of the canvas. She is nude except for sheer, gold-trimmed harem pants that covers her legs and touches the floor. The woman is heavily sexualized by her suggestive pose and how Matisse portrays the curvature of her body. Her breasts are round and idealized. The brushwork in the painting is loose and shows the gestural movements of the artist.

3. Title: Hans Christian Ørsted Monument. Fact: The monument consists of a bronze statue of Ørsted mounted on a granite plinth. Ørsted is seen demonstrating the effect of an electric current on a magnetic needle. With his hands he is connecting the wires from an electric battery, thereby making a magnet oscillate. At the foot of the statue sit the three Norns or goddesses of destiny in Norse mythology, Urðr (the past) who is noting the past, and Ørsted's name, on a tablet, Verðandi (the present), who with her distaff is spinning the thread of fate, and Skuld (the future), who is silently awaiting the fullness of time with a rune stick in her hand.

4. Title: Standing Woman (Noack). Fact: Despite the pressures of the Second World War, Astrid Noack maintained her belief in a world of peace and fellowship. This comes through in her sculptures of human figures which display openness towards mankind with such dignity. Measuring 157 x 47,5 x 56,5 cm, the upright "Standing Woman", arms hanging loosely by her sides and one leg slightly bent, faces forward, eyes and chest uplifted, intent yet at peace. Inspired by the sculpture of ancient Egypt and Greece, the figure is characterized by a monumental frontality with only a hint of movement in a bent knee and a hand loosely clutching a cloth. The statue exudes a timeless sense of calm with its austerely stringent form.

5. Title: Antependium. Fact: An antependium (from Latin "ante-" and "pendēre" "to hang before"; pl: "antependia"), also known as a "parament" or "hanging", or, when speaking specifically of the hanging for the altar, an altar frontal (Latin: "pallium altaris"), is a decorative piece, usually of textile, but also metalwork, stone or other material that can adorn a Christian altar.

Question: What instrument is being held by the woman on the left in Haiku Salut?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Concert (Gaspare Traversi). Fact: The painting depicts a small crowded room hosting a concert involving either a fortepiano or harpsichord, cello, and flute. The central figure, the bonnneted young women dressed in an elegant blue and yellow gown and playing the piano, gazes toward the spectator. To her right and surrounding the piano are fashionably dressed older men. Two hold canes, and two hold private conversations. Two fixate, perhaps leer, at the young woman. One gentleman holds perhaps a small wind instrument in his hand. Near the woman's right foot, is a cat, facing away from us. The scene, somewhat unsettling, appears to convey some cryptic allegory.

2. Title: Woman with a Lute. Fact: The painting depicts a young woman wearing an ermine-trimmed jacket and enormous pearl earrings as she eagerly looks out a window, presumably expecting a male visitor. "A musical courtship is suggested by the viola da gamba on the floor in the foreground and by the flow of songbooks across the tabletop and onto the floor," according to a web page about the work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art website. The tuning of a lute was recognized by contemporary viewers as a symbol of the virtue of temperance. The oil on canvas work is 20¼ inches high and 18 inches wide (51.4 × 45.7 cm). The painting's canvas was almost certainly cut from the same bolt as that used for "Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid".

3. Title: Violin technique. Fact: It is possible to play the violin holding it in a variety of ways. Most players hold the lower bout of the instrument between the left shoulder and the jaw, often assisted by a semi-permanently attached chinrest and detachable shoulder rest. If held properly under the chin, the violinist can let go of the instrument with their hands and it will stay there firmly. Other common ways to hold the instrument include the seated Carnatic attitude, with the scroll resting on a foot, or the dancing-master's "kit" or "pochette" hold, along the forearm, by the lower margin of the rib cage, even though these are not widely traditional holds. In Morocco the violin is often held completely upright resting on the seated player's thigh with the left hand stabilizing the balance while fingering.

4. Title: Lesiba. Fact: The lesiba (, term adopted in Sotho), and gora or goura (Khoisan, for a type of bird, term adopted by the Xhosa and Zulu), are members of a class of "unbraced mouth-resonated bow[s]" with a flattened quill attached to a long string, stretched over a hard stick, acting as the main source of vibration. Holding both hands around the quill, positioned without touching just inside the lips, the player sharply inhales or exhales against it, creating vibration in the string. This "produces a powerful buzzing sound," usually in short notes on a small, limited scale.

5. Title: Ahardin. Fact: Ahardin is a musical bow played by southern Tuaregs consists of a curved branch held with a twisted rope of raw leather or bark of acacia. Serving as a sound box, a reversed calabash is placed on the curved part of the bow on the ground. To hold the whole, the player presses her knee on the container. With the fingers of the left hand, as with the imzad, she defines the melody, while with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, she grip the string with a regular gesture vibrate. At present, the ahardin, an instrument whose manufacture is easily improvised, is considered above all as a game of girls.

Question: who is the royal albert hall named after
Query: Consider the following facts:

Designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic Revival style, it takes the form of an ornate canopy or pavilion tall, in the style of a Gothic ciborium over the high altar of a church, sheltering a statue of the prince facing south. It took over ten years to complete, the £120,000 cost (the equivalent of about £10,000,000 in 2010) met by public subscription.

4. Title: Memorial to the Great Exhibition. Fact: The Memorial to the Great Exhibition is an outdoor monument commemorating the Great Exhibition (1851) and depicting Albert, Prince Consort, designed by Joseph Durham with modifications by Sydney Smirke and located south of Royal Albert Hall in London, United Kingdom.

5. Title: Frieze of Parnassus. Fact: The Frieze of Parnassus is a large sculpted stone frieze encircling the podium, or base, of the Albert Memorial in London, England. The Albert Memorial was constructed in the 1860s in memory of Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria.

Question: does a macbook air have an ethernet port
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: MacBook Air. Fact: Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air, such as the reduction of lead to make it more environmentally friendly. The MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring, meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements, has a recyclable enclosure, and is rated EPEAT Gold. Its display is made from arsenic-free glass, and contains no mercury. To reduce the computer's size and weight, several features were sacrificed. It was Apple's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built-in removable media drive. It also omits a FireWire port, Ethernet port, line-in, media card slots (except the 13" 2010 through 2015 models, which have an SD card slot), and a Kensington Security Slot.

2. Title: AirPrint. Fact: AirPrint is a feature in Apple Inc.'s macOS and iOS operating systems for printing via a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), either directly to AirPrint-compatible printers, or to non-compatible shared printers by way of a computer running Microsoft Windows, Linux, or macOS. AirPrint does not require printer-specific drivers. It was originally intended for iOS devices and connected via a Wi-Fi network only, and thus required a Wi-Fi access point. However, with the introduction of AirPrint to the macOS desktop platform in 2012, Macs connected to the network via Ethernet connection could also print using the AirPrint protocol—not just those connected via Wi-Fi. Direct Wi-Fi connection between the device and the printer is not supported by default, but has appeared as the 'HP ePrint Wireless Direct AirPrint' feature.

3. Title: Open Systems Adapter. Fact: The Open Systems Adapter (OSA) is a network controller for IBM z/Architecture, ES/9000 and S/390 mainframes. The OSA supports Ethernet, Token Ring and FDDI connectivity.

4. Title: MAC address. Fact: MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet hardware address, hardware address, and "physical address". Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory, or by a firmware mechanism. Many network interfaces, however, support changing their MAC address. The address typically includes a manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI) managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): EUI-48, which replaces the obsolete term MAC-48, and EUI-64.

5. Title: IBox. Fact: The IBox software included the Winsock program and TCP/IP stack that were needed to connect a computer running Microsoft Windows to the Internet in 1994. The IBox package also included a licensed copy of the NCSA Mosaic web browser called "AIR Mosaic", AIR Mail (an email client), AIR News (an NNTP news client), AIR Telnet, AIR Gopher, and an FTP Network File Manager.

Question: Shape Shifter is the twenty-first studio album (thirty-sixth album overall) by who, "Gypsy Queen", a Szabó hit from 1966 covered by Santana in 1970 as a medley with Fleetwood Mac's "Black Magic Woman", Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shape Shifter (album). Fact: Shape Shifter is the twenty-first studio album (thirty-sixth album overall) by Santana. It was released on May 14, 2012. This album is the first from his new record label Starfaith Records, which is distributed by Sony Music Entertainment, owners of most of Santana's albums (except those recorded for Polydor Records which are owned by Universal Music Group). It is also the first album since 1992's Milagro that does not feature guest singers in any of the songs, a style that characterized Santana's albums since Supernatural. The album contains only one song with vocals ("Eres La Luz"). The track "Mr. Szabo" is a homage to the Hungarian guitarist Gábor Szabó, who released a series of 8 albums for Impulse Records between 1966 and 1967, and   one of Carlos Santana's early idols, and features a similar rhythmical and harmonic structure to "Gypsy Queen", a Szabó hit from 1966 covered by Santana in 1970 as a medley with Fleetwood Mac's "Black Magic Woman".

2. Title: Fleetwood Mac. Fact: Fleetwood Mac are  a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

3. Title: Voodoo Lounge. Fact: Voodoo Lounge is the 20th British and 22nd American studio album by British rock band The Rolling Stones, released in July 1994. As their first new release under their new alliance with Virgin Records, it ended a five-year gap since their last studio album, "Steel Wheels" in 1989. "Voodoo Lounge" is also the band's first album without long-time bassist Bill Wyman. He left the band in early 1991, though the Stones did not formally announce the departure until 1993. In 2009, the album was remastered and reissued by Universal Music. This album was released as a double album on vinyl and a single CD and cassette.

4. Title: UK Jive. Fact: UK Jive is the twenty-second studio album by the English rock group, the Kinks, released in 1989. It was the first album in almost three years since the 1986 album, "Think Visual". At this point, it was the longest gap between album releases since the inception of the group.

5. Title: Evolution (Hollies album). Fact: Like its predecessor, "For Certain Because", this album features only songs written by group members Allan Clarke, Graham Nash, and Tony Hicks. None of the songs on the album were selected for single or EP release in the UK, although "Carrie Anne" from the American release was issued as a single in the US. Drummer Bobby Elliott only played on three songs on the album due to appendicitis and, as a result, he was substituted for by Dougie Wright, Clem Cattini and Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience.

The book and film are inspired by the true story of Winter, a bottlenose dolphin that was rescued in December 2005 off the Florida coast and taken in by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Winter lost her tail after becoming entangled with a rope attached to a crab trap, and was fitted with a prosthetic one. The film was released on September 23, 2011, by Warner Bros.

The loss of her tail caused her to swim unnaturally with her tail moving side to side instead of up and down. As a result, she was fitted with a silicone-and-plastic tail that enabled her to swim normally. She has since become a highly popular attraction at the aquarium, which led to the film's creation. She lives in her pool with another two other dolphins, Hope and P.J., the former who is the subject of the 2014 sequel to "Dolphin Tale", "Dolphin Tale 2".

5. Title: Dolphin Tale 2. Fact: Dolphin Tale 2 is a 2014 American family film written and directed by Charles Martin Smith as the sequel to his 2011 film "Dolphin Tale".

The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $57.8 million.

As punishment, Miss Inch decides that they must live together in the isolated "Serendipity" cabin (and eat together at an "Isolation Table") for the remainder of the camp season. After discovering that they both come from single-parent homes, they soon realize they are twin sisters and that their parents, Mitchell "Mitch" Evers (Brian Keith) and Margaret "Maggie" McKendrick (Maureen O'Hara), divorced shortly after their birth, with each parent having custody of one of them. The twins, each eager to meet the parent she never knew, decide to switch places. Susan gives Sharon a matching haircut and has her bite her nails. They also take a crash-course getting to know each other while learning about each other's personalities and ways of life.

2. Title: The Parent Trap (1998 film). Fact: Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; Lindsay Lohan stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. David Swift wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on "Lottie and Lisa". The story is comparable to that of the 1936 Deanna Durbin film "Three Smart Girls". Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.

3. Title: The Parent Trap (song). Fact: "The Parent Trap" was the title song from the 1961 Disney film, "The Parent Trap". It was sung by teen idols, Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands and it was written by the songwriting brother team of Robert and Richard Sherman.

Question: is there heat transfer in an isothermal process
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Isothermal process. Fact: An isothermal process is a change of a system, in which the temperature remains constant: ΔT = 0. This typically occurs when a system is in contact with an outside thermal reservoir (heat bath), and the change will occur slowly enough to allow the system to continue to adjust to the temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange. In contrast, an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings (Q = 0). In other words, in an isothermal process, the value ΔT = 0 and therefore ΔU = 0 (only for an ideal gas) but Q ≠ 0, while in an adiabatic process, ΔT ≠ 0 but Q = 0.

2. Title: Isothermal flow. Fact: For an important practical case of a gas flow through a long tube, the model has an applicability in situations which occurs in a relatively long distance and where heat transfer is relatively rapid so that the temperature can be treated, for engineering purposes, as a constant. This model has also applicability as upper boundary to Fanno flow.

3. Title: Isothermal flow. Fact: Isothermal flow is a model of compressible fluid flow whereby the flow remains at the same temperature while flowing in a conduit. In the model, heat transferred through the walls of the conduit is offset by frictional heating back into the flow. Although the flow temperature remains constant, a change in stagnation temperature occurs because of a change in velocity. The interesting part of this flow is that the flow is choked at formula_1 and not at Mach number equal to one as in the case of many other model such as Fanno flow. This fact applies to real gases as well as ideal gases.

4. Title: Isochoric process. Fact: An Isochoric process, also called a constant-volume process an isovolumetric process or an isometric process in a thermodynamic process during which the volume of the closed system undergoing such a process remains constant. An isochoric process is exemplified by the heating or the cooling of the contents of a sealed, inelastic container: The thermodynamic process is the addition or removal of heat; the isolation of the contents of the container establishes the closed system; and the inability of the container to deform imposes the constant-volume condition. The isochoric process here should be a quasi-static process

5. Title: Isobaric process. Fact: Isobaric process is a thermodynamic process in which the pressure stays constant: Δ"P" = 0. The heat transferred to the system does work, but also changes the internal energy of the system. This article uses the physics sign convention for work, where positive work is work done by the system. Using this convention, by the first law of thermodynamics,

Question: What is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons, Ed, Edd n Eddy or Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Ed, Edd n Eddy. Fact: Ed, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series revolves around three preteen boys named Ed, Edd (called "Double D"), and Eddy—collectively known as "the Eds"—who live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the fictional town of Peach Creek. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.

2. Title: Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard. Fact: Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard (French: Arthur et la vengeance de Maltazard, also known in North America as Arthur and the Invisibles 2 or simply Arthur 2) is a 2009 English-language French animated/live-action feature film co-written, co-produced and directed by Luc Besson, based on his novel of the same title and starring Freddie Highmore and Mia Farrow. EuropaCorp produced the film, which is the second in Besson's Arthur series, following Arthur and the Invisibles. The film received generally negative reviews by critics. It was a success in France but, due to its predecessor's failure at the American box office, was released direct-to-video in the United States. It performed disappointingly in the rest of the world. As a result, the film and its sequel, Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds, generated huge money losses for EuropaCorp.

3. Title: Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show. Fact: Antonucci first announced a "90 minute special" in 2006, and its title in 2007. Originally set to air in 2007, its premiere date was then moved to 2008, the year it was completed in, and was finally set to release in 2009. Due to the movie, the series' sixth season was shortened, as Antonucci and the team at a.k.a. Cartoon wanted to focus on the production of the film. The score is composed by Patric Caird, who also composed the music for the series. The voice cast features all of the series' voice actors, while series voice director Terry Klassen was cast as Eddy's Brother. The film was a success in the ratings for Cartoon Network, posting double and triple digit ratings delivery gains and was met with a positive reception. It was also released on the US iTunes Store.

4. Title: Arthur (TV series). Fact: Arthur is a Canadian-American animated educational television series for children ages 4 to 8, created by Cookie Jar Group (formerly known as Cinar) and WGBH for PBS. The show is set in the fictional American city of Elwood City, and revolves around the lives of eight-year-old Arthur Read, an anthropomorphic aardvark, his friends and family, and their daily interactions with each other.

5. Title: D.N. Ace. Fact: D.N. Ace is a Canadian animated television series created by Matthew Wexler and produced by Nelvana. The show debuted on July 6, 2019 on Teletoon.

Question: cool runnings based off of a true story
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Memory of Running. Fact: The Memory of Running is a 2004 novel by Ron McLarty. Narrated by obese, single, and suddenly orphaned Vietnam War-veteran Smithy Ide, the book relates, in alternating chapters, his bike ride across the country, from East Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, to claim the body of his late, mentally unbalanced sister, and an examination of the broken life which had led him here.

2. Title: Cool Runnings. Fact: Cool Runnings is a 1993 American comedy sports film directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, and John Candy. The film was released in the United States on October 1, 1993. It was Candy's last film to be released during his lifetime. It is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsleigh team's debut in competition during the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The film received positive reviews, and the film's soundtrack also became popular with Jimmy Cliff's cover of "I Can See Clearly Now" reaching the top 40 as a single in nations such as Canada, France, and the UK.

3. Title: Rabbit, Run. Fact: The novel depicts three months in the life of a 26-year-old former high school basketball player named Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom who is trapped in a loveless marriage and a boring sales job, and his attempts to escape the constraints of his life. It spawned several sequels, including "Rabbit Redux", "Rabbit is Rich" and "Rabbit at Rest", as well as a related 2001 novella, "Rabbit Remembered". In these novels Updike takes a comical and retrospective look at the relentless questing life of Rabbit against the background of the major events of the latter half of the 20th century.

4. Title: Always Running. Fact: In the book, Rodriguez recounts his days as a member of a street gang in Los Angeles (specifically, East Los Angeles and the city's eastern suburbs), has been highly acclaimed and contrasted to the works of Louis-Ferdinand Celine and George Orwell's "Down and Out in Paris and London" in its description of the lives of desperate, impoverished individuals in big cities.

Question: Sphingolipid was named after which human-lion mythical creature?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sphinx. Fact: A sphinx (Ancient Greek: Σφίγξ [spʰíŋks], Boeotian: Φίξ [pʰíːks], plural sphinxes or sphinges) is a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.

2. Title: Pierus. Fact: Pierus (; ), in Greek mythology, is a name attributed to two individuals:

3. Title: Ancaeus. Fact: The name Ancaeus (; Ancient Greek: "Ankaîos") is attributed to two heroes in Greek mythology. Both were among the Argonauts, and each met his death at the tusks of a boar. They are often confused with one another.

4. Title: Sphingolipid. Fact: Sphingolipids, or glycosylceramides, are a class of lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid bases, a set of aliphatic amino alcohols that includes sphingosine.  They were discovered in brain extracts in the 1870s and were named after the mythological Sphinx because of their enigmatic nature. These compounds play important roles in signal transmission and cell recognition. Sphingolipidoses, or disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, have particular impact on neural tissue. A sphingolipid with an R group consisting of a hydrogen atom only is a ceramide. Other common R groups include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers, yielding cerebrosides and globosides, respectively. Cerebrosides and globosides are collectively known as glycosphingolipids.

5. Title: Amphitherium. Fact: "Amphitherium" comes from the Greek "amphi" meaning 'on both sides', and "therion" meaning 'wild beast'. This was in reference to de Blainville's incorrect belief that the original fossil jaw of this animal was not a mammal, but something in between mammals and reptiles.

Question: where did the first settlers of canada come from
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of Canada. Fact: Starting in the late 15th century, French and British expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of New France was established in 1534 and was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the Seven Years' War. The now British Province of Quebec was divided into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791 and reunified in 1841. In 1867, the Province of Canada was joined with two other British colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia through Confederation, forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new dominion expanded by incorporating other parts of British North America, finishing with Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.

2. Title: History of cities in Canada. Fact: During the Wisconsin glaciation 50,000-17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to northwestern North America (Alaska). Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years. Arriving in Canada around 16,500-13,000 years ago after initially inhabiting the territories of Alaska, archaeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first "widespread" habitation of Canada and further south occurred during the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the late glacial maximum. Yet Canada's first people did not build towns or cities upon arrival. They were few in number compared to the size of the North American continent and most lived a nomadic subsistence lifestyle, following the migration of animal herds that provided food.

3. Title: History of Toronto. Fact: The history of Toronto begins approximately 12,500 years ago, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet, a continental glacier that covered northeastern North America, retreated from the area of present-day Toronto. Soon afterward small groups of Indigenous people moved into the area to hunt animals such as caribou. Archaeological finds in the area have included artifacts of First Nations dating back several thousand years. Prior to 1000 AD, the Wyandot people were likely the first group to live in the area, followed by the Iroquois. When Europeans first came to Toronto, they found a small village known as Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. Between visits by European explorers, the village was abandoned by the Iroquois, who moved south of Lake Ontario and the Mississaugas, a branch of the Ojibwa settled along the north shore of the lake.

4. Title: History of immigration to Canada. Fact: Anthropologists continue to argue over various possible Models of migration to the New World to modern-day Canada, as well as their pre-contact populations. The Inuit are believed to have arrived entirely separately from other indigenous peoples around 1200 CE. Indigenous peoples contributed significantly to the culture and economy of the early European colonies and as such have played an important role in fostering a unique Canadian cultural identity.

5. Title: 16th century in Canada. Fact: The 16th century in Canada saw the first contacts, since the Norsemen 500 years earlier, between the indigenous peoples in Canada living near the Atlantic coast and European fishermen, whalers, traders, and explorers.

Question: is land rover the same as range rover
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Range Rover. Fact: The Land Rover Range Rover (generally known simply as a Range Rover) is a full-sized luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Land Rover, a marque of Jaguar Land Rover. The Range Rover was launched in 1970 by British Leyland. This flagship model is now in its fourth generation.

2. Title: Range Rover (L322). Fact: The Range Rover (L322) (usually known simply as the "Range Rover") is the third-generation Range Rover model from British car maker Land Rover and was originally developed under the codename 'L30'.

3. Title: Range Rover (P38A). Fact: It is usually known as the Range Rover P38 or P38A outside of Land Rover, after the office building in which the vehicle development team was based. During the early development stages, the Engineering team was based in the Engineering Block at Solihull, and the vehicle was known by the project designations of 'Pegasus' and 'Discovery,' changing to P38A when the team moved to Block 38A at Solihull. The name 'Discovery' was used temporarily as a cover to confuse journalists while the original Discovery vehicle was being developed. During production Land Rover referred to it as either the 'New Range Rover' or by its model designation of 'LP'.

4. Title: Rover Company. Fact: The Rover Company Limited was a British car manufacturing company that operated from its base in Solihull in Warwickshire. Its lasting reputation for quality and performance was such that its first postwar model reviewed by "Road & Track" in 1952 was pronounced finer than any but a Rolls-Royce. Rover also manufactured the Land Rover from 1948 onwards, which spawned the Range Rover in 1970, and went on to become its most successful and profitable product — with Land Rover eventually becoming a separate company and brand in its own right.

5. Title: Land Rover. Fact: Land Rover is a British brand of four-wheel drive cars, that exclusively offers premium and luxury sport utility vehicles. Owned by multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which has been owned by India's Tata Motors since 2008, JLR currently build Land Rovers in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom.

Question: what is the make of a land rover
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Land Rover. Fact: Land Rover is a car brand that specialises in four-wheel-drive vehicles, owned by British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, which has been owned by India's Tata Motors since 2008. The Land Rover is regarded as a British icon, and was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951.

2. Title: Rover (space exploration). Fact: A rover (or sometimes planetary rover) is a planetary surface exploration device designed to move across the solid surface on a planet or other planetary mass celestial bodies. Some rovers have been designed as land vehicles to transport members of a human spaceflight crew; others have been partially or fully autonomous robots. Rovers are typically created to land on another planet (other than Earth) via a lander-style spacecraft, tasked to collect information about the terrain, and to take crust samples such as dust, soil, rocks, and even liquids. They are essential tools in space exploration.

3. Title: Land Rover 1/2 ton Lightweight. Fact: In the early 1960s both the Royal Marines, then largely based aboard commando carriers, and the British Army required a vehicle that could be carried by air. They had taken delivery of the Westland Wessex helicopter, which could carry a load slung beneath.

4. Title: Land yacht (automobile). Fact: A land yacht is an informal category of large automobiles. While full-size cars are manufactured worldwide to this day, the term is most often used in reference to cars built in North America between 1960 and 1976. Distinguished from both limousines and truck-based vehicles (vans and SUVs), land yachts are among the largest mass-produced cars ever manufactured.

5. Title: Space Exploration Vehicle. Fact: The Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) is a modular vehicle concept developed by NASA. It would consist of a pressurized cabin that can be mated either with a wheeled chassis to form a rover for planetary surface exploration (on the Moon and elsewhere) or to a flying platform for open space missions such as servicing satellites and missions to near-Earth asteroids. The concept evolved from the Lunar Electric Rover (LER) concept, which in turn was a development of the Small Pressurized Rover (SPR) concept.

Question: the only one full-length folk epic which has survived in english literature
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Beowulf. Fact: Beowulf (/ˈbeɪəwʊlf/; Old English: [ˈbeːo̯wulf]) is an Old English epic story consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines. It may be the oldest surviving long story in Old English and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Old English literature. The date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025. The author was an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, referred to by scholars as the "Beowulf author".

2. Title: Edmund Spenser. Fact: Edmund Spenser (; 1552/1553 – 13 January 1599) was an English poet best known for "The Faerie Queene", an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse, and is often considered one of the greatest poets in the English language.

3. Title: Piers Plowman tradition. Fact: The Piers Plowman tradition is made up of about 14 different poetic and prose works from about the time of John Ball (died 1381) and the Peasants Revolt of 1381 through the reign of Elizabeth I and beyond. All the works feature one or more characters, typically Piers, from William Langland's poem "Piers Plowman". (A much larger number of texts, with less obvious connection to Piers Plowman, may also be considered part of the tradition.) Because the Plowman appears in the "General Prologue" to "The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer but does not have his own tale (one of seven such characters), plowman tales are sometimes used as additions to "The Canterbury Tales", or otherwise conflated or associated with Chaucer.

4. Title: Alliterative Morte Arthure. Fact: The Alliterative "Morte Arthure" is a 4346-line Middle English alliterative poem, retelling the latter part of the legend of King Arthur. Dating from about 1400, it is preserved in a single copy, in the early 15th-century Lincoln Thornton Manuscript.

5. Title: Heroic drama. Fact: Heroic drama is a type of play popular during the Restoration era in England, distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter. The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; John Dryden's "The Indian Emperour" (1665) and Roger Boyle's "The Black Prince" (1667) were key developments.

Question: Sonja Kristina starred in which musical that had lyrics by James Rado and Gerome Ragni?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hair (musical). Fact: Hair:  The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical is a rock musical with a book and lyrics by James Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot. A product of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the late 1960s, several of its songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War peace movement.  The musical's profanity, its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of sexuality, its irreverence for the American flag, and its nude scene caused much comment and controversy.  The musical broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of "rock musical", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a "Be-In" finale.

2. Title: Sonja Kristina. Fact: Sonja Kristina  (born Sonja Christina Shaw, 14 April 1949, in Brentwood, Essex) is an English songwriter, musician and actress, best known for starring in the seminal 1960s musical, Hair, and for being the lead vocalist of the 1970s progressive rock band, Curved Air.

3. Title: La Strada (musical). Fact: La Strada is a musical with lyrics and music by Lionel Bart, with additional lyrics by Martin Charnin and additional music by Elliot Lawrence. It is based on the 1954 film of the same name by Federico Fellini. Bart wrote the score in 1967 and made a demonstration recording, although the musical was not produced until 1969, when it was famously cancelled after just one performance. The musical's book was written by Charles K. Peck, Jr., who also produced it on Broadway.

4. Title: Illyria (musical). Fact: Illyria is a musical with book, music, and lyrics by Peter Mills, based on William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, written in 2002. Illyria is a traditional adaption of Twelfth Night, but features a more contemporary score.

5. Title: Radamisto (Handel). Fact: It was first performed at the King's Theatre, London on 27 April 1720, a performance attended by King George I and his son, the Prince of Wales, and was judged to be a success, resulting in 10 further performances. A revised version with different singers including the internationally renowned castrato Senesino in the first of many roles he performed in Handel's works was written for a revival on 28 December 1720. More revisions followed for yet another version presented in 1721. In 1728 "Radamisto" was again revised for another revival featuring the two famous prima donnas Cuzzoni and Faustina as well as Senesino. The first modern performance was in Göttingen on 27 June 1927.

Question: How many novels are in the C.S. Lewis series that the Brazilian series "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo" has been compared to?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series). Fact: Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (literally translated and roughly known as "the Yellow Woodpecker Farm" or "the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch") is the title given to a series of 23 fantasy novels written by Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and as the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. Lobato's single original adult fiction, a sci-fi novel entitled O Presidente Negro ("The Black President") set in the far future, would not achieve the same popularity of Sítio. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 novel A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado, and was later republished as the first chapter of Reinações de Narizinho, which is the first novel of the actual Sítio series. The main setting is Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, where a boy, a girl and their living and thinking toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning.  On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as the Clear Waters Kingdom, and outer space. Sítio is often symbolized by the character of Emília, Lobato's most famous creation alongside Jeca Tatu.

2. Title: Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (fictional farm). Fact: The Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (literally translated and roughly known as the Yellow Woodpecker Farm or the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch) is the primary setting for the series of children's novels, "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", written by the Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato. The place is described as "a small farm with a pretty cottage, surrounded by trees" and close to several other subsettings: a stream, a virgin forest and a small village, both named the Tucanos.

3. Title: The Chronicles of Narnia. Fact: The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels by C. S. Lewis. It is considered a classic of children's literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages. Written by Lewis, illustrated by Pauline Baynes, Chris Van Allsburg in 1978, and Leo and Diane Dillon in 1994, and originally published in London between 1950 and 1956, The Chronicles of Narnia has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, the stage, and film.

4. Title: José Lins do Rego. Fact: José Lins do Rego Cavalcanti (July 3, 1901 in Pilar Paraíba – September 12, 1957 in Rio de Janeiro) was a Brazilian novelist most known for his semi-autobiographical "sugarcane cycle." These novels were the basis of films that had distribution in the English speaking world. Along with Graciliano Ramos and Jorge Amado he stands as one of the greatest regionalist writers of Brazil According to Otto Maria Carpeaux, José Lins was "the last of the story tellers". His first novel, Menino de Engenho ("Boy from the plantation"), was published with difficulty, but soon it got praised by the critics.

5. Title: Macunaíma (novel). Fact: The novel follows a young man, Macunaíma, "a hero without a character," born in the Brazilian jungle and possessing strange and remarkable abilities—mostly shapeshifting—, as he travels to São Paulo and back again. The protagonist is often considered a representation of the Brazilian personality. The novel employs a composite structure using elements of what would later be called magic realism and a number of dialects of both interior Brazil and São Paulo. It is based on Andrade's research in language, culture, folklore, and music of the indigenous peoples in Brazil.

Question: What are the men wearing on their heads in Northfork?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Gook (headgear). Fact: A gook was a piece of protective headgear worn by bal maidens (female manual labourers in the mining industries of Cornwall and Devon). The gook was a bonnet which covered the head and projected forward over the face, to protect the wearer's head and face from sunlight and flying debris. Bal maidens often worked outdoors or in very crude surface-level shelters, and the gook also gave protection from extreme weather conditions. By covering the ears, gooks protected the ears from the noisy industrial environment.

2. Title: Nábrók. Fact: Nábrók (calqued as necropants, literally "corpse britches") are a pair of pants made from the skin of a dead man, which are believed in Icelandic witchcraft to be capable of producing an endless supply of money. It is unlikely these pants ever existed outside of folklore.

3. Title: Headless men. Fact: Blemmyes are said to occur in two types: with eyes on the chest or with the eyes on the shoulders. Epiphagi, a variant name for the headless people of the Brisone, is sometimes used as a term referring strictly to the eyes-on-the-shoulders type.

4. Title: Ochipok. Fact: An ochipok is a cap that covers the entire head with a slit in the back and laces that pull it tightly around the head.

5. Title: Jeep cap. Fact: The jeep cap, sometimes referred to as jeep hat, originally the US Army issued M1941 wool knit cap is a knit cap with a short visor made mostly from knitted yarn, originally wool, but now typically acrylic. Also sometimes referred to as a "skull cap" due to its popularity with skateboarders (although the term "skull cap" is also used for a variety of completely different caps), or a "Radar cap" due to the cap being made famous by the character Radar O'Reilly from the hit US TV sitcom M*A*S*H.

Question: How many statues are visible on the building in front of Murcia?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Monument of the Four Moors. Fact: It is the most famous monument of Livorno and is located in Piazza Micheli. Created by Pietro Tacca, the monument takes its name from the four bronze statues of "Moorish" slaves that are found at the base of an earlier work consisting of the statue of Ferdinando I and its monumental pedestal.

2. Title: Statues of Pegasus, Mexico City. Fact: The statues of Pegasus are installed outside Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes, in Mexico. The four sculptures, designed by Spanish artist Agustí Querol Subirats, were originally installed in the city's Zócalo.

3. Title: Santoni. Fact: The Santoni are a collection of statues carved into a rock face near Palazzolo Acreide, the ancient Akrai, in Sicily.

4. Title: Bulls of Guisando. Fact: The Bulls of Guisando  are a set of Celtiberian sculptures located on the hill of Guisando in the municipality of El Tiemblo, Ávila, Spain.

5. Title: Rua Augusta Arch. Fact: The Rua Augusta Arch (Portuguese: "Arco da Rua Augusta") is a stone, triumphal arch-like, historical building and visitor attraction in Lisbon, Portugal, on the "Praça do Comércio". It was built to commemorate the city's reconstruction after the 1755 earthquake. It has six columns (some 11 m high) and is adorned with statues of various historical figures. Significant height from the arch crown to the cornice imparts an appearance of heaviness to the structure. The associated space is filled with the coat of arms of Portugal. The allegorical group at the top, made by French sculptor Célestin Anatole Calmels, represents Glory rewarding Valor and Genius.

Question: What color is the award from the Filmfare Awards?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Filmfare Awards. Fact: The Filmfare Awards are a set of awards that honour artistic and technical excellence in the Hindi-language film industry of India. The Filmfare ceremony is one of the most prestigious film events in the world. The awards were first introduced by The Times Group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards. They were initially referred to as the "Clare Awards" or "The Clares" after Clare Mendonca, the editor of "The Times of India". A dual voting system was developed in 1956. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts.

2. Title: Filmfare Awards. Fact: The ceremony had been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions. During several years in the 1990s, a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons. Since 2000, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held already. From 2018 the ceremony is televised on Colors. The 64th edition of the Filmfare Awards was held on 23 March 2019 at Jio Garden BKC, Mumbai.

3. Title: Filmfare Special Award. Fact: It acknowledges a special and unique performance and encourages artistes, filmmakers and musicians to break new ground in drama, direction, music and acting. It is only given if someone has done something really different. However, it is also given occasionally to film personalities for their contribution to the film industry.

4. Title: 63rd Filmfare Awards. Fact: 63rd Filmfare Awards ceremony, presented by the Filmfare Magazine, honored the best Hindi language Indian films of 2017. The ceremony was held on 20 January 2018 and hosted by Shah Rukh Khan, Ayushmann Khurrana, Parineeti Chopra and Karan Johar.

5. Title: Filmfare Awards South. Fact: Unlike the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by Government of India, the Filmfare Awards South are voted for by both the public and a committee of experts. The Filmfare Awards has been referred to as India's equivalent to the Academy Awards for its ostentatious ceremonies and media coverage, although the National Film Awards is more commonly given this distinction for its critical rigour and pan-Indian appeal.

Question: What does Manuela Maleeva wear around her neck?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Mantilla. Fact: A mantilla is a traditional Spanish lace or silk veil or shawl worn over the head and shoulders, often over a high comb called a "peineta", popular with women in Spain. It is also worn, without the peineta, by Eastern Orthodox women in Russia, often white, with the ends crossed over neck and draped over the opposite shoulder. The shape, design and use are different from an ordinary veil.

2. Title: Pussy bow. Fact: A lavallière, also called a pussycat bow, is a style of neckwear often associated with women's and girls' blouses and bodices. It takes the form of a bow tied at the neck similar to those tied around the necks of kittens and cats.

3. Title: Rebozo. Fact: A rebozo is a long flat garment worn mostly by women in Mexico. It can be worn in various ways, usually folded or wrapped around the head and/or upper body to shade from the sun, provide warmth and as an accessory to an outfit. It is also used to carry babies and large bundles, especially among indigenous women. The origin of the garment is unclear, but most likely derived in the early colonial period, as traditional versions of the garment show indigenous, European and Asian influences. Traditional rebozos are handwoven from cotton, wool, silk and rayon in various lengths but all have some kind of pattern (usually from the ikat method of dying) and have fringe, which can be finger weaved into complicated designs. The garment is considered to be part of Mexican identity and nearly all Mexican women own at least one. It has been prominently worn by women such as Frida Kahlo, actress María Félix and former Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala and still popular in rural areas of the country. However, its use has diminished in urban areas.

4. Title: Zuria. Fact: Traditional zurias go to the ankles, with a gauze hood around the head and shoulders. Today a "zuria" comes in different forms and designs with an extra sheen due to the demands of fashion. Zurias are worn during holidays, weddings, or parties.

5. Title: Gamurra. Fact: A gammura, (or sometimes a camora or camorra) was an Italian (particularly Florence) style of women's dress popular in the 15th and early 16th centuries. It consisted of a fitted bodice and full skirt worn over a "camicia" (a type of chemise). Early styles were front-laced, but the fashion later changed to side-laced styles.

It tells the story of Ned Rowlands, a talented stagecoach driver who meets the three creatures he loves best on the same day: a horse, a woman, and the man who will become his employer, (Lord Ironminster).

2. Title: John Cameron Peddie. Fact: John Cameron Peddie, (1887 – 1968) known as "J Cameron Peddie", was born on 17 May 1887 at Conland, Forgue, Aberdeenshire.

A crucial plot element of the book is the idiom "on the gripping hand" (OTGH), a three-armed variation of the idiom "on the other hand" similar in meaning to "on the third hand", but with the added sense that the third-mentioned consideration is the most important one. The saying is native to the alien Moties, who have three arms, one of which is stronger but possesses less finesse. The idiom has also gained some use among fans of the book.

4. Title: Hand of Glory. Fact: A Hand of Glory is the dried and pickled hand of a male person who has been hanged, often specified as being the left  hand, or, if the man was hanged for murder, the hand that "did the deed."

Question: What is the animal in the middle of the Providence Reds logo?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Mr. Red. Fact: Mr. Red is the first mascot of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He is a humanoid figure dressed in a Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball for a head. Sometimes, Mr. Red is referred to by the team as "The Running Man" for the way he has posed on the logo c. 1968.

2. Title: Major League Baseball logo. Fact: According to Dior, the logo was created in a single afternoon. Contrary to popular belief, the silhouette was not modeled on Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, or any specific player but was drawn with reference to photographs of several players. The silhouette was chosen specifically because of its ambiguity: the batter could be right- or left-handed and of any ethnic background.

3. Title: Logos and uniforms of the St. Louis Cardinals. Fact: The St. Louis Cardinals are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise whose players sport jerseys with the famous birds on the bat and interlocking StL logos. The Cardinals first got their name in 1900 from the cardinal red trim on their uniforms and adopted the image of the cardinal birds perched on the bat in 1922. Since then, the uniforms have consistently retained the birds theme while undergoing noticeable modification of both the portrayal and "Cardinals" and "St. Louis" script interchangeably used.

4. Title: Screech (mascot). Fact: Screech is the mascot of the Washington Nationals. He is a bald eagle that wears the home cap and jersey of the team. He was "hatched" on April 17, 2005 at the "Kids Opening Day" promotion at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington D.C., Glenda Gutierrez, designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team and explained that it was "strong and eats almost everything."

5. Title: Major League Baseball logo. Fact: The Major League Baseball logo was designed by Jerry Dior in 1968 and was included on all on-field uniforms of Major League Baseball (MLB) employees beginning in the 1969 season.

Question: What is to the left of Carrie Underwood's mouth?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Watch Your Mouth. Fact: It tells the story of protagonist Joseph's lust-filled college summer spent with his Jewish girlfriend Cynthia Glass in her hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Handler has described it as an "opera in book form".

2. Title: Philtrum. Fact: The philtrum (, "philtron," lit. "love charm"), or medial cleft, is a vertical indentation in the middle area of the upper lip, common to many mammals, extending in humans from the nasal septum to the tubercle of the upper lip. Together with a glandular rhinarium and slit-like nostrils, it is believed to constitute the primitive condition for at least therian mammals. Monotremes lack a philtrum, though this could be due to the specialised, beak-like jaws in living species.

3. Title: Epiglottic vallecula. Fact: The epiglottic vallecula is a depression (vallecula) just behind the root of the tongue between the folds in the throat. These depressions serve as "spit traps"; saliva is temporarily held in the valleculae to prevent initiation of the swallowing reflex.

4. Title: Mandibular lateral incisor. Fact: The mandibular lateral incisor is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face) from both mandibular central incisors of the mouth and mesially (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular canines. As with all incisors, their function is for shearing or cutting food during mastication, commonly known as chewing. There are no cusps on the teeth. Instead, the surface area of the tooth used in eating is called an incisal ridge or incisal edge. Though relatively the same, there are some minor differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular lateral incisor and that of the permanent mandibular lateral incisor.

5. Title: Incisive papilla. Fact: The incisive papilla is a projection on the palate near the incisors.

Question: What is the main color of the Tennis ball?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Tennis ball. Fact: A tennis ball is a ball designed for the sport of tennis. Tennis balls are fluorescent yellow at major sporting events, but in recreational play can be virtually any color. Tennis balls are covered in a fibrous felt which modifies their aerodynamic properties, and each has a white curvilinear oval covering it.

2. Title: Tennis ball. Fact: Modern tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce criteria to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as . Balls must have masses in the range . Yellow and white are the only colors approved by the ITF, and most balls produced are a fluorescent yellow known as "optic yellow", first introduced in 1972 following research demonstrating they were more visible on television.

3. Title: Tennis (paper game). Fact: Tennis is an (abstract) strategic pencil and paper game for two players. The game field consists of 4 fields and a centre line. These are called (-2,-1,0,1,2), with negative numbers belonging to player 1, positive to player 2. At start, the ball is at the centre line (0).

4. Title: Tennis. Fact: Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

5. Title: Table tennis racket. Fact: Table tennis regulations approved by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) allow different surfaces on each side of the paddle for various amounts of spin (including nullifying it) or speed. For example, a player may have a spin-heavy rubber on one side of his paddle, and no spin on the other side. The player can flip the racket in play for different types of returns. To help a player distinguish between different types of rubber used by his opponent, regulations specify that one side of a paddle must be red while the other must be black, allowing a player to see what side of a paddle hits the ball mid-play. The player has the right to inspect his opponent's racket before a match to see the type and color. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the paddle cannot be exchanged for another at any time during a match.

Question: what color is Rajendra Prasad shirt
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rajesh Pratap Singh. Fact: Singh originally from Rajasthan, graduated from NIFT, Delhi in 1994, however he was trained with New Delhi-based designer David Abraham for a year, before graduating. He, further went to work with the Italian menswear label, Marzotto for two years.

Pratap's exploration with fabric texturing and most prominently his creative usage of pin tucks has almost become synonymous to the label. The key to his work lies in simplicity, clean cuts and flawless detailings. The designer's belief in silence is reflected in the name of his pret line "RIP" (Rest in Peace). Pratap has showcased in collections in Paris and Milan as well apart from India

2. Title: Daura-Suruwal. Fact: In Nepal, the traditional male dress, which is also the national dress, is the Nepali shirt called daura and suruwal  or daura-suruwal suit. According to Hussein (2018), "the daura is a closed-neck shirt with five pleats and eight strings that serve to tie it around the body".

3. Title: Jodhpuri. Fact: The material can be silk or any other suiting material. Normally, the material is lined at the collar and at the buttons with embroidery. This can be plain, jacquard or jamewari material. Normally, the trousers match that of the coat. There is also a trend to wear contrasting trousers to match the coat colour.

4. Title: Daura-Suruwal. Fact: Daura-Suruwal is the national outfit of Nepalese men. The Daura is a variant of the Kurta and is the upper garment, the Suruwal is the trouser. The coat was added to the costume by Jang Bahadur Rana, a prime minister of Nepal in the 19th century. The outfit is also popular in Darjeeling in neighbouring India amongst people of Nepali origin.

5. Title: Raj pattern. Fact: The "raj pattern" was devised by King Chulalongkorn during his visit to British India in 1871, where he hired a Calcutta tailor to make a jacket with a standing collar and buttoned vertical opening. Previously in 1870, the king had had his entourage dress in a combination of "chong kraben" (a wrap worn with part of the fabric folded back between the legs and tucked behind the waist) and Western suit jacket, socks and shoes during his visit to Singapore and Java. This new jacket replaced the suit jacket, alleviating the need for a separate layer of shirt in the hot climate, and the dress soon became the de facto civil uniform. It was worn both officially and privately and remained popular until the Pibulsonggram era, when the "chong kraben" was banned by cultural mandate. The name "raj pattern", from Pali "rājā" and English "pattern" and meaning "royal pattern", was coined by Phon Bunnak (later the Chao Phraya Phasakorawong), who was acting as royal secretary during the king's journey.

Question: How many people in this photo of In the Heat of the Night (TV series) are wearing a suit?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Suit (2016 film). Fact: In 1950s Sophiatown, South Africa, a man forces his wife to treat her lover's suit as if it were a person, with tragic consequences.

2. Title: Suits (film). Fact: Written and directed by Eric Weber; director of photography Peter Nelson; edited by Nancy Novack; music by Pat Irwin; additional music by Air Supply; produced by Chris Giordano; Released by Tenafly Film Company.

3. Title: Dress Suits to Hire. Fact: Described as a "lesbian noir" piece, "Dress Suits" tells all about two women, Deeluxe and Michigan, who are shacking up in the lobby of a clothing rental shop in the East Village. As the action begins, the more butch partner, Deeluxe (Peggy Shaw), slips on a pair of nylon stockings while singing a love song in a husky baritone. She wears gender roles as one might put on a shirt, seeming equally comfortable in a button-down item or a camisole. Moments later, she asphyxiates herself with her right arm, but this becomes only a minor obstacle; even death is but a costume for these women. (Incidentally, the aforementioned arm develops into its own character named "Little Peter" later in the play.). The show's heated fantasies, brassy broads and sexual charades make for a carnivorous free-for-all.

4. Title: Jessica Mae Stover. Fact: Despite sometimes appearing in personally designed "uniforms," Jessica Mae Stover is frequently not recognized by press and fans, even at her own events. She has remarked that this effect is "somewhat intentional." The following three photos to the left were captured in the same week and illustrate the drastic differences that often reside in her outward appearance, leading to difficulties in recognizing the artist off-screen.

5. Title: The Night of the White Pants. Fact: Max Hagan, a Texas oil tycoon, is going through a difficult divorce. When his soon-to-be ex-wife throws him out of his house with nothing but the clothes he's wearing (including the titular "white pants"), he becomes entangled in a sex, drugs and rock-'n'-roll-laden adventure with his daughter's punk-rocker boyfriend as he tries to make things right between himself and his dysfunctional family.

The duo released their first studio album, "In the Garden", in 1981 to little success, but went on to achieve global success when their second album "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", was released in 1983. The title track became a worldwide hit which topped the charts in various countries including the US. The duo went on to release a string of hit singles and albums before they split up in 1990. By this time Stewart was a sought-after record producer, while Lennox began a solo recording career in 1992 with her debut album "Diva". After almost a decade apart, the Eurythmics reunited to record their ninth album, "Peace", released in late 1999. They reunited again in 2005 to release the single "I've Got a Life", as part of a new Eurythmics compilation album, "Ultimate Collection".

2. Title: Peacetour (Eurythmics video). Fact: Peacetour is a live concert video by the British pop/rock duo Eurythmics released on 20 June 2000 on VHS and DVD. It is a recording of the band's concert at London Docklands Arena on 6 December 1999, which was the final show of their 24-date world "Peace Tour". All profits from the tour were donated to Amnesty International and Greenpeace.

3. Title: Eurythmics. Fact: The duo have won an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 1984, the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1987, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1999, and in 2005 were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. The Eurythmics have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide. In 2017, the group was nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and were nominated again in 2018.

4. Title: Eulogies (band). Fact: Former Eulogies bass player Tim Hutton and Chris Reynolds originally began playing with Peter Walker under the aegis of his solo work. After touring the US extensively in 2006, the trio was reborn under the name Eulogies. Drew Phillips joined the band in 2008, while Garrett Deloian joined the band in January 2009 (replacing bassist Tim Hutton, who left Eulogies shortly after recording resumed for their second album). They are signed to Los Angeles indie label Dangerbird Records, through which they released their self-titled debut album on September 11, 2007. The album was co-produced by fellow Dangerbird labelmate Hrishikesh Hirway (The One A.M. Radio). Eulogies toured North America in support of that album in summer 2007 with Sea Wolf and in fall 2007 with Film School.

5. Title: AE LIVE. Fact: AE_LIVE is a series of live recordings by British electronic music duo Autechre, initially released on 29 October 2015 by Warp Records.

Question: What type of animal print is behind her in Believe (Cher song)?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Believe (Cher song). Fact: "Believe" is a song recorded by American singer Cher for her twenty-second album, "Believe" (1998), released by Warner Bros. Records. It was released as the lead single from the album on October 19, 1998. It was written by Brian Higgins, Stuart McLennen, Paul Barry, Steven Torch, Matthew Gray and Timothy Powell, with Cher also contributing, and was produced by Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling.

2. Title: Believe (Cher album). Fact: "Believe" represents a complete musical departure from her previous works, consisting of Euro disco oriented styles, while its lyrical topics include freedom, individualism and relationships. The album features some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Auto-tune, which would eventually become known as the "Cher effect". Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, who commended Cher's vocal performance, while others criticized the high amount of vocoder and its overall production. It won one Grammy for "Best Dance Recording" from a total of three nominations.

3. Title: Believe (Cher song). Fact: "Believe" departed from Cher's pop rock style of the time for an upbeat dance-pop style. It featured a pioneering use of the audio processing software Auto-Tune to create a deliberate vocal distortion, which became known as the "Cher effect". The lyrics describe empowerment and self-sufficiency after a painful breakup.

4. Title: Foolish (album). Fact: The cover art is credited to the band's bassist, Laura Ballance. Ballance has stated that although the painting has generated much speculation into its deeper meaning, it was simply an "unpracticed" attempt to hark back to an American Music Club album cover. She was the only model available to her, and the dead rabbit was added after she had watched the Michael Moore film "Pets or Meat".

5. Title: Dream House 78' 17&quot;. Fact: Cover, labels, design and calligraphy are by Marian Zazeela, and are drawn in her trademark magenta on a black background.

Question: amityville the awakening what happened to the brother
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Amityville: The Awakening. Fact: Teenager Belle Walker moves to 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island with her mother Joan, little sister Juliet, and brain-dead twin brother, James. The family's impetus for moving there was to be closer to Dr. Milton, a neurologist hoping to treat James, who suffered an accident that has left him on life support. Upon moving in, Juliet tells Belle that James has been talking to her lately, "using a lot of curse words." One night, James flatlines, but is mysteriously revived and opens his eyes.

2. Title: Amityville II: The Possession. Fact: Anthony Montelli and his wife, Dolores, move into the house of their dreams with their children, Sonny, Patricia, Mark, and Janice "Jan". Things go well at first, but everything changes after it is discovered that there is a tunnel in the basement leading into the house from an unknown place.

3. Title: The Amityville Curse. Fact: Five people spend the night in an abandoned haunted house in Amityville, New York and soon find themselves terrorized by assorted ghosts, venomous insects and ghostly spirits.

4. Title: Juniper, Gentian, and Rosemary. Fact: Juniper (age 16), Gentian (age 14), and Rosemary Meriweather (age 11) are three sisters living happily in Minneapolis in 1994, when their lives are disrupted – first, by the appearance of a strange house (which Gentian cannot remember being built) in the vacant lot next door, and second, by the appearance of Dominic Hardy, a teenage boy who speaks in quotations and riddles, and who recruits Gentian's help to build a time machine.

5. Title: Chapter 4 (American Horror Story). Fact: Matt and Shelby argue about the former's encounter with Scathach; of which he has no memory and his secret deal to leave and destroy the house. While bathing, Shelby is attacked by the Piggy Man but is saved by Dr. Elias Cunningham who banishes the beast with the chant "Croatoan". Once safe, he explains "Croatoan" is a word of dark and sinister power. He further explains that he has been the house's guardian for years but a lack of money to pay the property taxes led to the house being put up for auction and sold to the Millers. Cunningham leads the Millers to the basement and shows them his research on the house. According to him, all the disappearances seem to occur on the same six day lunar cycle in October. Cunningham relays that the first to disappear was Edward Phillipe Mott, who built the house in 1792; there were multiple other disappearances. He then asks the Millers to leave, but they insist on staying to search for Flora. The doctor then leads the Millers to where Priscilla is keeping Flora as hostage. On the way they encounter Scathach. Shelby chases her, but comes in front of the ghosts who begin to converge on her. She tries in vain to banish them with the Croatoan spell. Cunningham pleads with Priscilla to release Flora but before he can secure her release, he is shot to death by arrows from Thomasin's men. The Millers flee back to the house where Cricket is waiting for them.

Question: What is over the ears of the man on the left who is playing Hip hop music?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The One on the Right Is on the Left. Fact: The song is a humorous criticism of musicians that put their political views into their music. It tells the story of a folk song group that is "long on musical ability", but ultimately breaks up due to political differences.

2. Title: Left of Cool. Fact: "Left of Cool" is the first album to feature Jeff Coffin, who had already toured with the band after the departure of Howard Levy. The album cover depicts Future Man, Béla Fleck, and Victor Wooten standing on Coffin's head.

3. Title: Bass Brothers. Fact: Although Interscope Records marketed Dr. Dre as Eminem's major producer, the Bass Brothers have in fact produced more individual tracks for Eminem than Dr. Dre. Jeff also got a tattoo of his name across the chest and Jeff Bass performed the "Public Service Announcements" that introduce both "The Slim Shady LP" and "The Marshall Mathers LP". Most recently, he performed the "Another Public Service Announcement" from D12's album "Devil's Night" when he got punched by Rondell Beene, who replaces him as the announcer for that album.

4. Title: Two turntables and a microphone. Fact: "Two turntables and a microphone" is the basic concept of a DJ's equipment. This phrase describes turntables (phonographs) and a microphone connected to a mixer. The DJ uses the mixer's crossfader to fade between two songs playing on the turntables. Fading often includes beatmatching. Live hip hop music also often has an MC rapping into the microphone. In nightclubs the microphone is usually used only for announcements.

5. Title: For Free? (Interlude). Fact: The song's accompanying music video premiered on July 31, 2015 on Lamar's Vevo account. It starts with a woman (Darlene Tibbs) voicing the introductory spoken word section while actress/model Hikeah Kareem appears as the woman in the video lip-syncing the section. She rants off a long list of complaints about her "unfortunate" partner/pimp, played by Lamar before he appears - face pressed to a screen door - and proceeds to chase her around the estate while rapping and yelling, “This dick ain’t free!” Then, Lamar appears again from behind a window with a live band and pops his head into the bathroom. In the Joe Weil & The Little Homies-directed clip, Lamar takes a number of forms terrorizing his partner. The visual metaphors aligns with those of the song's lyrics, both asserting his own self-worth to a woman and to the marginalizing temptations of "success" in America.

The last Pontiac badged cars were built in December 2009, with one final vehicle in January, 2010. Franchise agreements for Pontiac dealers expired October 31, 2010, leaving GM to focus on its four remaining North American brands: Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC.

2. Title: List of Pontiac vehicles. Fact: This is a list of Pontiac vehicles. Pontiac was a brand of automobiles manufactured and sold by General Motors (GM); though production ended in 2009, Pontiac remains a registered and active trademark of GM.

4. Title: Pontiac Solstice. Fact: The Solstice was nominated for the "North American Car of the Year" award and "Design of the Year" award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) for 2006. It was a runaway hit for Pontiac, with 7,000 orders in the first 10 days of availability and 6,000 more orders before winter. Although first-year production was planned at 7,000, GM apologized to customers for delays and increased production, delivering 10,000 by March 1.

Question: does mary ellen become a doctor on the waltons
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of The Waltons characters. Fact: Mary Ellen (Judy Norton Taylor) is the oldest of Liv and John's daughters, born in April 1920, aged 13 in season one. Throughout the first few seasons, she is a typically whiny, sometimes rebellious teenager, somewhat of a tomboy who enjoys playing baseball, but could also be vain, engaging in a rivalry with rich-girl Martha-Rose Coverdale for the affections of the awkward G.W. Haines (David Doremus). Mary Ellen matures into a wiser young woman and her childish fantasy of becoming a movie star gives way for a more reasonable and realistic ambition to go into medicine after reading up on it and developing an interest. She then works to gain an education as a medical worker, and becomes a nurse. However, when she ends up taking care of the people out in the country by herself, she concludes they need more medical expertise than she can offer them and continues studying medicine until she succeeds in becoming a fully-fledged doctor. Even though some people frown upon female doctors and she receives mixed support from her family, she refuses to let this stop her. Mary Ellen has a special relationship with each of her six siblings, but she is especially close to her younger sister Erin. Mary Ellen and Erin fought a lot when they were younger girls, particularly in seasons 1 and 2. But in the middle seasons, Mary Ellen and Erin matured and became friends. In season 5 after Mary Ellen married Curt, her relationship with her sister deepened even further and by the end of the show, they truly did become each other's best friend.

2. Title: Judy Norton Taylor. Fact: Judy Norton-Taylor (born January 29, 1958) is an American actress and theater director who is best known for her role as Mary Ellen Walton on "The Waltons" television series and subsequent Waltons TV movies.

She has won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series a record four times; three for "The Waltons" (1973, 1974, 1976), and one for "Nurse" (1982).

4. Title: Molly Lansing. Fact: Molly Lansing-Davis is a fictional character of ABC's "General Hospital". The role has been portrayed by Haley Pullos since 2009. Molly is the daughter of Ric Lansing and Alexis Davis. She was born on-screen on November 10, 2005. In 2009, Molly's birth year is changed to 1998. In 2012, Molly states that she is 15, effectively making her birth year 1997.

5. Title: Nancy Priddy. Fact: Nancy Lee Priddy (born January 22, 1941) is an American actress and singer-songwriter. As an actress, she has appeared on many television series, including "Bewitched", "The Waltons", and "Matlock". She is the mother of actress Christina Applegate.

Question: what is Simon Pagenaud holding in the air?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Simon (1980 film). Fact: The Institute for Advanced Concepts, a group of scientists with an unlimited budget and a propensity for elaborate pranks, brainwash a psychology professor named Simon Mendelssohn who was abandoned at birth and manage to convince him, and the rest of the world, that he is of extraterrestrial origin. Simon escapes and attempts to reform American culture by overriding TV signals with a high-powered TV transmitter, becoming a national celebrity in the process.

2. Title: Ballooning (spider). Fact: Ballooning, sometimes called kiting, is a process by which spiders, and some other small invertebrates, move through the air by releasing one or more gossamer threads to catch the wind, causing them to become airborne at the mercy of air currents and potentially electric currents. This is primarily used by spiderlings to disperse; however, larger individuals have been observed doing so as well. The spider climbs to a high point and takes a stance with its abdomen to the sky, releasing fine silk threads from its spinneret until it becomes aloft. Journeys achieved vary from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres. Even atmospheric samples collected from balloons at five kilometres altitude and ships mid-ocean have reported spider landings. Mortality is high.

3. Title: Ballooning (spider). Fact: Ballooning is a behaviour in which spiders and some other invertebrates use airborne dispersal to move between locations. A spider (usually limited to individuals of a small species), or spiderling after hatching, will climb as high as it can, stand on raised legs with its abdomen pointed upwards ("tiptoeing"), and then release several silk threads from its spinnerets into the air. These automatically form a triangular shaped parachute which carries the spider away on updrafts of winds where even the slightest of breezes will disperse the arachnid. The Earth's static electric field may also provide lift in windless conditions. Ballooning behavior may be triggered by favorable electric fields.

4. Title: Sōjōbō. Fact: Sōjōbō is an ancient "yamabushi" (mountain hermit) tengu with long, white hair and an unnaturally long nose. He carries a fan made from seven feathers as a sign of his position at the top of tengu society. He is extremely powerful, and one legend says he has the strength of 1,000 normal tengu. Sōjōbō lives on Mount Kurama (north of Kyoto).

5. Title: Simon Says. Fact: Simon Says (or Simple Simon Says) is a children's game for three or more players. One player takes the role of "Simon" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as "jump in the air" or "stick out your tongue") to the other players, which should be followed only when prefaced with the phrase "Simon says". Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase "Simon says". It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted. In many regions of the United States Simon says is also known as “Simon Sez”.

Question: Is there a body of water in this photo of Lugano?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Lake Lugano. Fact: Lake Lugano ( or , from ; ; ) is a glacial lake which is situated on the border between southern Switzerland and Northern Italy. The lake, named after the city of Lugano, is situated between Lake Como and Lago Maggiore. It was cited for the first time by Gregory of Tours in 590 with the name "Ceresio", a name which is said to have derived from the Latin word "cerasus", meaning cherry, and refers to the abundance of cherry trees which at one time adorned the shores of the lake. The lake appears in documents in 804 under the name "Laco Luanasco".

2. Title: Lake Lugano. Fact: Well-known mountains and tourist destinations on the shores of the lake are Monte Brè to the east, Monte San Salvatore west of Lugano, and Monte Generoso on the south-east shore. The World Heritage Site Monte San Giorgio is situated south of the lake.

3. Title: Alpine Pool. Fact: The work is one of a series of paintings of a small Alpine stream that Sargent executed while staying in the small village of Purtud in the Val d’Aosta, Northern Italy. In this painting, the artist was attempting to record in close-up the effect of sunlight on still clear water lying between a border of rocks and foliage.

4. Title: Baptism of Christ (Mantegna). Fact: "Baptism" is incomplete and was probably worked up by Francesco, a less-skilled artist - the colour on the mantle of the unknown character on the right may be his work. Above is the Holy Spirit descending as a dove, whilst a figure to the left is probably an angel holding Christ's garments. The central background is hilly, whilst the looming rock to the right is similar to that in "Triumph of Virtue" (1499-1502). The orange tree to the right and the lemon tree to the left recall the background of the "Trivulzio Madonna" (1497).

5. Title: Boating (Manet). Fact: Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a man (believed to be Manet's brother in law, Rodolphe Leenhoff) and an unknown woman boating on the River Seine at Argenteuil in the Paris suburbs.

Question: who has the highest scope of work in Mikhail Romm or Rupert Wyatt
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rupert Wyatt. Fact: Rupert Wyatt (born 26 October 1972) is an English screenwriter, director, and producer. He made his directorial debut with the 2008 film The Escapist, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. His second film was the 2011 blockbuster Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

2. Title: Mikhail Romm. Fact: Mikhail Ilych Romm (Russian: Михаи́л Ильи́ч Ромм; 24 January [O.S. 11 January] 1901 – 1 November 1971) was a Soviet film director.

3. Title: Alexander Vassiliev. Fact: Alexander Vassiliev (; born 1962) is a Russian journalist, writer, and espionage historian living in London who is a subject matter expert in the Soviet KGB and Russian SVR. A former officer in the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB), he is known for his two books based upon KGB archival documents: "Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America", co-authored with John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, and "The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America: the Stalin Era," co-authored with Allen Weinstein.

4. Title: Christopher Story. Fact: Christopher Edward Harle Story FRSA (8 March 1938 – 14 July 2010) was an English writer, publisher and government adviser specialising in intelligence and economic affairs, who is perhaps best known for his collaboration with KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn on the 1995 book "The Perestroika Deception".

5. Title: David Hagberg. Fact: David Hagberg (October 9, 1942 – September 8, 2019) was an American novelist best known for his techno-thrillers featuring super-spy Kirk McGarvey. Hagberg also wrote under the pseudonym Sean Flannery, Nick Carter, David Bannerman, David James, Robert Pell, and Eric Ramsey. Hagberg's style has been described as a cross between Tom Clancy and Ian Fleming. His thrillers generally feature a combination of technical detail, timely plots and super-spy heroics that are sometimes almost prophetic in their accuracy . In the novel "Joshua's Hammer", for example, written in 2000, Hagberg gives a chilling account of a mega-terrorist plot by Osama bin Laden to kill thousands of Americans on their home soil, published a full year before the World Trade Center Attacks. His scenario of McGarvey tracking bin Laden to his urban lair in Pakistan and shooting him in the head—far from Tora Bora’s caves—was described and executed in "Allah’s Scorpion" (2007) four years before the eerily similar event echoed Hagberg’s novel.

Question: when did the rams come to st louis
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of the St. Louis Rams. Fact: The professional American football franchise now known as the Los Angeles Rams played in St. Louis, Missouri, as the St. Louis Rams from the 1995 through the 2015 seasons before relocating back to Los Angeles where the team played from the 1946 season to the 1994 season. The Rams franchise relocated from Los Angeles to St. Louis in 1995, which had been without a National Football League (NFL) team since the Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1988. The Rams’ first home game in St. Louis was at Busch Memorial Stadium against the New Orleans Saints on September 10, 1995, before the Trans World Dome (later the Edward Jones Dome, and now known as The Dome at America's Center) was completed for their November 12 game against the Carolina Panthers. Their last game played at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17, 2015, which they won, 31–23. The Rams’ last game as a St. Louis-based club was on January 3, 2016, against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium, where they lost in overtime 19–16.

2. Title: History of the Los Angeles Rams. Fact: On January 12, 1946, Dan Reeves was denied a request by the other National Football League (NFL) owners to move his team, the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles and the then-103,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Reeves threatened to end his relationship with the NFL and get out of the professional football business altogether unless the Rams transfer to Los Angeles was permitted. A settlement was reached and, as a result, Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles. Consequently, the NFL became the first professional coast-to-coast sports entertainment industry.

3. Title: History of the Cleveland Rams. Fact: The professional American football team now known as the Los Angeles Rams was established in Cleveland as the Cleveland Rams, and played there from 1936 to 1945. The Rams competed in the second American Football League (AFL) for the 1936 season and the National Football League (NFL) from 1937–1945, winning the NFL championship in 1945, before moving to Los Angeles in 1946 to become the only NFL champion ever to play the following season in another city. The move of the team to Los Angeles helped to jump-start the reintegration of pro football by African-American players and opened up the West Coast to professional sports. After being based in Los Angeles for 49 years, the Rams franchise moved again after the 1994 NFL season to St. Louis. In 2016, the team moved back to Los Angeles after 21 seasons in St. Louis.

4. Title: Los Angeles Rams Cheerleaders. Fact: They were established in 1974 during the team's original tenure in Los Angeles and were known as the Embraceable Ewes. The cheerleading organization became known as the "St. Louis Rams Cheerleaders" when the team moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Beginning with the 2016 NFL season, the organization changed their name to the "Los Angeles Rams Cheerleaders" to associate themselves with the recently relocated Los Angeles Rams football team.

5. Title: Los Angeles Rams. Fact: The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams, based in Cleveland, Ohio. The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured players such as William "Bud" Cooper, Harry "The Horse" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian. Damon "Buzz" Wetzel joined as general manager.

Question: what is the constitutional convention in new york
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: New York state Constitutional Convention of 2018. Fact: The New York state Constitutional Convention of 2018–19 is a proposed body that would revise the constitution of the State of New York, subject to the approval of the voters. Section 2 of Article XIX of the state constitution requires that every 20 years the ballot question “Shall there be a convention to revise the constitution and amend the same?” be submitted to the voters. This referendum, the 13th in almost a quarter of a millennium, will be held in November 2017. If the referendum is approved, delegates to the convention will be elected in November 2018.

2. Title: New York Constitution. Fact: New York State has held nine Constitutional Conventions: in 1776–1777, 1801, 1821, 1846, 1867–1868, 1894, 1915, 1938, and 1967; a Constitutional Commission in 1872–1873; and a Judicial Convention in 1921. Despite this, the state has had only four essentially "de novo" constitutions in its history, those of 1777 (replacing the former colonial charter), 1821, 1846, and 1894.

3. Title: Constitutional Convention (United States). Fact: The Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention the Federal Convention, or the Grand Convention at Philadelphia) took place from May 25 to September 17, 1787, in the old Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. Although the Convention was intended to revise the league of states and first system of government under the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them James Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton of New York, was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington of Virginia, former commanding general of the Continental Army in the late American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and proponent of a stronger national government, to become President of the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the Constitution of the United States, placing the Convention among the most significant events in American history.

4. Title: New York General Assembly. Fact: The New York General Assembly was first convened on October 17, 1683 during the governorship of Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick, which passed an act entitled "A Charter of Liberties" that decreed that the supreme legislative power under the Duke of York (later King James II) shall reside in a governor, council, and the people convened in general assembly; conferred upon the members of the assembly rights and privileges making them a body coequal to and independent of the British Parliament; established town, county, and general courts of justice; solemnly proclaimed the right of religious liberty; and passed acts enunciating certain constitutional liberties, e.g. taxes could be levied only by the people met in general assembly; right of suffrage; and no martial law or quartering of the soldiers without the consent of the inhabitants.

5. Title: Albany Convention. Fact: When news of the Glorious Revolution reached the Province of New York in 1689, Jacob Leisler led a rebellion in which he appointed himself ruler of the Province of New York. Albany was the only centre which resisted Leisler's claims to leadership. Under the leadership of Peter Schuyler and Robert Livingston the Albany Convention was formed which remained loyal to William and Mary. Leisler's year-long attempt to subdue the Albany Convention led to a number of military engagements.

Question: What is Chris Benoit wearing on his chest?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Codpiece. Fact: A codpiece (from , meaning "scrotum") is a covering flap or pouch that attaches to the front of the crotch of men's trousers, enclosing the genital area. It may be held closed by string ties, buttons, folds, or other methods. It was an important fashion item of European clothing during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In the modern era, clothing devices with similar functions as codpieces are worn in some styles of underwear, in the leather subculture, and in performance costumes, such as for rock music and metal musicians. A similar device with rigid construction, an athletic cup, is used as protective underwear for male athletes.

2. Title: Breastplate. Fact: A breastplate or chestplate is a device worn over the torso to protect it from injury, as an item of religious significance, or as an item of status. A breastplate is sometimes worn by mythological beings as a distinctive item of clothing.

3. Title: Corslet. Fact: A corslet is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "a piece of defensive armour covering the body." In ancient Egypt, Ramesses II is said to have worn a similar device in some battle(s). In Ancient Greek armies, the "hoplite", or heavy infantryman, wore a bronze corslet or known as the "thorax" (or a linen version known as the linothorax) to protect his upper body. The corslet consisted of two plates connected on the sides via hinges and bronze pins. By the 16th century, the corslet, also spelled corselet, was popular as a light-half-armour for general military use, e.g., by town guards. It was made up of a gorget, breast covering, back and tassets, full arms and gauntlets.

4. Title: Lamen (magic). Fact: A lamen (Latin, meaning "plate") is a magical pendant or breastplate worn around the neck so that it hangs upon the breast over the heart. Its uses vary but, most commonly, the term refers to a symbol of authority and a focus of magical energies. Aleister Crowley described the lamen as "a sort of Coat of Arms. It expresses the character and powers of the wearer." Crowley and DuQuette have proposed that the magical lamen might be a modern adaptation of the priestly breastplate of the ancient Hebrews.

5. Title: Hammer pants. Fact: MC Hammer often wore them during live concerts and music videos.

Question: Is River of Wine based in America or Asia?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: River of Wine. Fact: The story takes place in the Qing Dynasty, revolving around the Sung and Leung family. Madam Leung (Nancy Sit) is the owner of a small business with eldest son Leung Ching-yiu (Bowie Lam), second son Leung Ching-hong (Sunny Chan), eldest daughter Leung Sau-man (Casper Chan) and youngest daughter Leung Sau-yin (Cilla Lok). Yiu originally was a worker at the Jiujiang brewery but due to a natural disaster, rewrote the lives of the Leung and Sung family.

2. Title: River of Earth. Fact: The book focuses on three years in the life of an Appalachian family as told from the viewpoint of a young boy. The boy watches as his parents are pulled between their meager but independent life as farmers, and the uncertain promise of prosperity offered by the mining camps in Appalachia.

3. Title: Russian River Brewing Company. Fact: Russian River Brewing Company is a brewery and brewpub in downtown Santa Rosa, California, with a second location in Windsor. The company makes strong India pale ales and sour beers.

4. Title: Kermit Lynch. Fact: Kermit Lynch (born December 1941 Bakersfield, California) is an American wine importer and author based in Berkeley, California. He is the author of "Adventures on the Wine Route," which won the Veuve Clicquot Wine Book of the Year award, as well as "Inspiring Thirst". He also co-owns Domaine Les Pallières in Gigondas along with the Brunier family of Domaine du Vieux Télégraphe in Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

5. Title: The River (EP). Fact: "The River" was written and produced from the fall of 2009 to the winter of 2010 by Michael Silver at his home and "on trains." It was inspired by "Fitzcarraldo" (1982), a German adventure-drama film by Werner Herzog that, in the words of writer Jonny Coleman, is about "academic (white) men who go out on culturally touristic crusades." Coleman highlighted that these "academic (white) men" formed the presence of Imperialism in the world due to their crusades. He analyzes that "The River" follows a character who is stranded in a rural, tribal land, where "benevolent polyrhythms share space with civilized instruments like synths and drum machines." The vinyl cover of "The River", designed by Kevin O’Neill, is a map of what led the title character of Herzog's film to achieve "madness and freedom."

Question: where does the story charlotte web take place
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Charlotte's Web (2006 film). Fact: Produced by Walden Media, Jordan Kerner's The K Entertainment Company and Nickelodeon Movies, the film premiered in Australia on December 7, 2006 and was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures on December 15, 2006 in the United States. The film was both a critical and commercial success, having grossed $144.9 million worldwide, and grossing another $95.2 million in US DVD sales , against an $85 million budget.

2. Title: Charlotte's Web (2006 film). Fact: Charlotte's Web is a 2006 American comedy-drama film based on the 1952 children's novel of the same name by E. B. White. Directed by Gary Winick and written by Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick, it is the second film adaptation of White's book following a 1973 animated version produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. The film stars Dakota Fanning, Kevin Anderson, and Beau Bridges, with voices provided by Dominic Scott Kay, Julia Roberts, Steve Buscemi, John Cleese, Oprah Winfrey, Cedric the Entertainer, Kathy Bates, Reba McEntire, and Robert Redford.

3. Title: 1635: The Tangled Web. Fact: The main setting takes place in Fulda in 1633 and follows in four interlinking stories which ties together near the end of the novel.

4. Title: Charlotte's Web. Fact: After her father spares the life of a piglet from culling it as runt of the litter, a little girl named Fern Arable nurtures the piglet lovingly, naming him Wilbur. On greater maturity, Wilbur is sold to Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman, in whose barnyard he is left yearning for companionship but is snubbed by other barn animals, until befriended by a barn spider named Charlotte, living on a web overlooking Wilbur's enclosure. Upon Wilbur's discovery that he is intended for slaughter, she promises to hatch a plan guaranteed to spare his life. Accordingly, she secretly weaves praise of him into her web, attracting publicity among Zuckerman's neighbors who attribute the praise to divine intervention. As time passes, more inscriptions appear on Charlotte's webs, increasing his renown. Therefore, Wilbur is entered in the county fair, accompanied by Charlotte and the rat Templeton, whom she employs in gathering inspiration for her messages. There, Charlotte spins an egg sac containing her 514 unborn children, and Wilbur, despite winning no prizes, is later celebrated by the fair's staff and visitors (thus made too prestigious alive to justify killing him). Exhausted apparently by laying eggs, Charlotte remains at the fair and dies shortly following Wilbur's departure. Having returned to Zuckerman's farm, Wilbur guards Charlotte's egg sac and is saddened further when the new spiders depart shortly after hatching. The three smallest remain, however, and take up residence in the doorway where Charlotte used to live. Pleased at finding new friends, Wilbur names one of them Nellie, while the remaining two name themselves Joy and Aranea. The book then concludes by mentioning that more generations of spiders kept him company in subsequent years.

5. Title: Web of Dreams. Fact: The novel opens with Annie Casteel Stonewall returning to Farthinggale Manor for the funeral of her father, Troy Tatterton. Annie, hoping to finally put the past to rest alongside her mother Heaven, feels drawn to the suite that used to be occupied by her great-grandmother, Jillian. Annie soon discovers a forgotten diary hidden away in a back drawer in Jillian's suite. The diary was written by Leigh VanVoreen, Annie's grandmother and Heaven's mother. Surprised by the discovery, Annie begins to read the tragic story of Leigh.

During the first attack on Christian, Rose sees Mason's ghost and freezes - and is accused of being a sore loser by her teachers. In a sudden twist, Christian is the only person who truly believes that Rose didn't screw up on purpose.

3. Title: Kissing Shakespeare. Fact: American teenager Miranda Graham believes that she has Shakespeare in her genes: she hopes one day to follow her parents’ footsteps as a Shakespearean actress. After her disastrous performance in her school's staging of "The Taming of the Shrew", her fellow cast member, Stephen Langford, steps out of the backstage and asks if she'd like to meet William Shakespeare in person. Miranda thinks he's insane. But before she can object, Stephen uses a spell to magically transport them both back to 16th century England–the time period Stephen is actually from, in the year 1581, at Lancashire. He wants Miranda to use her acting skills and modern-day charms on a teenage Shakespeare. Without her help, Stephen claims, the world will lose its greatest playwright.

4. Title: The Kiss (Rodin sculpture). Fact: The sculpture, "The Kiss", was originally titled Francesca da Rimini, as it depicts the 13th-century Italian noblewoman immortalised in Dante's "Inferno" (Circle 2, Canto 5) who falls in love with her husband Giovanni Malatesta's younger brother Paolo. Having fallen in love while reading the story of Lancelot and Guinevere, the couple are discovered and killed by Francesca's husband. In the sculpture, the book can be seen in Paolo's hand. The lovers' lips do not actually touch in the sculpture, suggesting that they were interrupted and met their demise without their lips ever having touched.

5. Title: Damon and Pythias. Fact: In Greek historic writings, Damon and Pythias (or Phintias; (gen.: Δάμωνος), Πυθίας, Φιντίας) is a legend illustrating the Pythagorean ideal of friendship. Pythias is accused of and charged with plotting against the tyrannical Dionysius I of Syracuse. Pythias requests of Dionysius to be allowed to settle his affairs on the condition that his friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should he, Pythias, not return, be executed in his stead. When Pythias returns, Dionysius, amazed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees them both.

Question: town replaced by kampala as ugandan capital in 1962
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Kampala. Fact: The city grew as the capital of the Buganda kingdom, from which several buildings survive, including the Kasubi Tombs (built in 1881), the Lubiri Palace, the Buganda Parliament and the Buganda Court of Justice. In 1890, British colonial administrator Frederick Lugard constructed a forum along Mengo Hill within the city, which allowed for the British to occupy much of the territory controlled by the Buganda, including Kampala. In 1894, the British government officially established a protectorate within this territory, and in 1896, the protectorate expanded to cover the Ankole, Toro Kingdom, and Bunyoro kingdoms as well. In 1905, the British government formally declared the entire territory to be a British colony. From that time until the independence of the country in 1962, the capital was relocated to Entebbe, although the city continued to be the primary economic and manufacturing location for Uganda. In 1922, the Makerere Technical Institute, now known as Makerere University, started as the first collegiate institution both within Kampala, and within the British colonies on the east coast of Africa. Following the 1962 independence, Milton Obote became president of Uganda, and held the position until 1971, when former sergeant Idi Amin defeated his government in a military coup. He proceeded to expel all Asian residents living within Kampala, and attacked the Jewish population living within the city. In 1978, he invaded the neighboring country of Tanzania, and in turn, the government there started the Uganda–Tanzania War, which created severe damage to the buildings of Kampala. Since then, the city has since then been rebuilt with constructions of new construction of hotels, banks, shopping malls, educational institutions, and hospitals and the improvement of war torn buildings and infrastructure. Traditionally, Kampala was a city of seven hills, but over time it has come to have a lot more.

2. Title: Battle of Kampala. Fact: The Battle of Kampala was a battle of the Ugandan Bush War that took place from 17 to 26 January 1986 in which forces of the National Resistance Army (NRA) attacked and captured the Ugandan capital, Kampala, from the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). As a result, the Ugandan government was deposed and replaced by a new one under NRA leader Yoweri Museveni.

3. Title: Fall of Kampala. Fact: The Fall of Kampala, also known as the Liberation of Kampala (Kiswahili: "Kukombolewa kwa Kampala"), was a battle during the Uganda–Tanzania War in 1979, in which the combined forces of Tanzania and the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) attacked and captured the Ugandan capital, Kampala. As a result, Ugandan President Idi Amin was deposed, his forces were scattered, and a UNLF government was installed.

4. Title: Battle of Kampala. Fact: In 1981 Museveni initiated an insurgency in Uganda against the government, which was controlled by the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF). He soon joined the nascent National Resistance Movement (NRM) and took control of its armed wing, the NRA. In 1985 the NRA inflicted several key defeats on the UNLF's armed wing, the UNLA, leaving the Ugandan capital, Kampala, vulnerable to attack. Feeling pressured, the UNLF government led by President Tito Okello pursued negotiations with the NRM. The resulting peace agreement failed to end the conflict, and Okello amassed a large force of UNLA troops and allied militias to garrison Kampala in preparation for an attack, though its effectiveness was weakened by low morale, internal friction, and subterfuge. On 17 January 1986 the NRA began advancing on Kampala. They managed to occupy territory around the city, but the UNLA stemmed their advance by placing an artillery battery at a strategic roundabout. On 24 January the UNLA withdrew its battery, and the NRA began its main attack.

5. Title: Masvingo. Fact: The city was known as Fort Victoria until 1982, when its name was briefly changed to Nyanda. Nyanda is the name of a nearby mountain about 10 kilometers south of the town on the Masvingo to Beitbridge Road. The name was changed to Masvingo after there were protests because "Nyanda" means "one who has lice." What's more the public sentiment was the Masvingo would be more reflective of the history of the city. "Masvingo" means "fort" in Shona and the Great Zimbabwe, which is essentially a walled fort, is often referred to as "Masvingo eZimbabwe" or sometime "Masvingo eVitori," meaning "the fort near Fort Victoria." So, within a few months its name was changed again from Nyanda to Masvingo. It is the oldest colonial settlement in Zimbabwe, and grew up around the encampment established in 1890 when the British South Africa Company "Pioneer Column" of the first colonist passed through on their way to what became Salisbury, now Harare. The Old Fort national monument is located in the centre of town, and was erected in 1891 as one of a series of fortifications to guard the route from Salisbury to the south. The very first cricket match in Zimbabwe is said to have taken place close by in 1890.

Question: how heavy are the stones in olympic curling
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Curling. Fact: The curling stone (also sometimes called a rock in North America) is made of granite and is specified by the World Curling Federation, which requires a weight between 38 and 44 pounds (17.24 and 19.96 kg), a maximum circumference of 36 inches (914.4 mm) and a minimum height of 4.5 inches (114.3 mm). The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the running surface, a narrow, flat annulus or ring, 0.25 to 0.50 inches (6.4 to 12.7 mm) wide and about 5 inches (130 mm) in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring and the inside of the ring is hollowed concave to clear the ice. This concave bottom was first proposed by J. S. Russell of Toronto, Ontario, Canada sometime after 1870, and was subsequently adopted by Scottish stone manufacturer Andrew Kay.

2. Title: Eight-ender. Fact: An eight-ender, also called a snowman, is a perfect score within a single end of curling. In an end, both sides throw eight rocks, and in an eight-ender, all eight rocks from one team score points.

3. Title: Curling at the Winter Olympics. Fact: Until 2018, men's and women's events were contested. An additional event, mixed doubles, was rejected for 2010 because the Olympic Programme Commission felt it had not developed enough, but was approved for the 2018 Winter Olympics at an IOC Executive Board meeting in June 2015.

4. Title: Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament. Fact: Great Britain, Switzerland, and the United States each finished round robin play with a 5-4 record, resulting in a three-way tie for third place in the preliminary round standings. Under Olympic tiebreaker rules then in effect, the United States was awarded the third seed in the medal round (by virtue of having defeated both Great Britain and Switzerland during the preliminary round), and Great Britain and Switzerland played a one-game tiebreaker (in which Switzerland prevailed 9-5 and was awarded the fourth seed).

5. Title: Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed doubles tournament. Fact: On 18 February 2018, it was reported that bronze medallist Alexander Krushelnitskiy of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team had failed a drug test and was awaiting a test of the B sample. After the testing of the B sample, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed that they were instituting formal proceedings; three days later, CAS disqualified the Olympic Athletes from Russia team and stripped them of the bronze medal, which was reawarded to the Norwegian team.

Question: can a commercial jet break the sound barrier
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sound barrier. Fact: Although Concorde and the Tu-144 were the first aircraft to carry commercial passengers at supersonic speeds, they were not the first or only commercial airliners to break the sound barrier. On 21 August 1961, a Douglas DC-8 broke the sound barrier at Mach 1.012 or 1,240 km/h (776.2 mph) while in a controlled dive through 41,088 feet (12,510 m). The purpose of the flight was to collect data on a new leading-edge design for the wing. A China Airlines 747 may have broken the sound barrier in an unplanned descent from 41,000 ft (12,500 m) to 9,500 ft (2,900 m) after an in-flight upset on 19 February 1985. It also reached over 5g.

2. Title: Jet noise. Fact: In aeroacoustics, jet noise is the field that focuses on the noise generation caused by high-velocity jets and the turbulent eddies generated by shearing flow. Such noise is known as broadband noise and extends well beyond the range of human hearing (100 kHz and higher). Jet noise is also responsible for some of the loudest sounds ever produced by mankind.

3. Title: Jet blast. Fact: A large jet-engined aircraft can produce winds of up to as far away as behind it at 40% maximum rated power. Jet blast can be a hazard to people or other unsecured objects behind the aircraft, and is capable of flattening buildings and destroying vehicles

4. Title: Jet blast. Fact: Jet blast is the phenomenon of rapid air movement produced by the jet engines of aircraft, particularly on or before takeoff.

5. Title: Hush kit. Fact: A hush kit is an aerodynamic device used to help reduce the noise produced by aircraft jet engines. These devices are typically installed on older turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines, as they are much louder than later high-bypass turbofan engines.

Question: when did the first plane break the sound barrier
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sound barrier. Fact: One of the highest recorded instrumented Mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the Mach 0.891 for a Spitfire PR XI, flown during dive tests at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough in April 1944. The Spitfire, a photo-reconnaissance variant, the Mark XI, fitted with an extended 'rake type' multiple pitot system, was flown by Squadron Leader J. R. Tobin to this speed, corresponding to a corrected true airspeed (TAS) of 606 mph. In a subsequent flight, Squadron Leader Anthony Martindale achieved Mach 0.92, but it ended in a forced landing after over- revving damaged the engine.

2. Title: John Derry. Fact: Squadron Leader John Douglas Derry DFC (5 December 1921 – 6 September 1952) was a British test pilot who is believed to be the first Briton to have exceeded the speed of sound in flight.

3. Title: Chuck Yeager. Fact: Charles Elwood Yeager (; born February 13, 1923) is a former United States Air Force officer, flying ace, and record-setting test pilot. In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight.

4. Title: 1947 Avianca Douglas DC-4 crash. Fact: Mount El Tablazo was shrouded in fog when, at 12:18 local time, the aircraft crashed into it at an elevation of about 10,500 feet. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error, with the crew deviating from the designated airway and flying below a safe altitude.

5. Title: A Song of Flight. Fact: The song was first performed by the Irish baritone Harry Plunket Greene in St. James's Hall on 2 March 1900, together with After, Op. 31, No. 1.

Question: does tyler perry play joe in the madea movies
Query: Consider the following facts:

Fact: In Goes to Jail, Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail. She, however, began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties. Madea's brother Joe (also played by Perry) refers to her as a "po-po ho", meaning someone who is a professional at evading law enforcement.

It stars Nicolas Cage and Tye Sheridan, revolving around a tormented man who hires a 15-year-old boy and protects him from his abusive father.

4. Title: Joe Pesci. Fact: His comedy roles include such films as "Home Alone" (1990), "My Cousin Vinny" (1992), "" (1992), and the "Lethal Weapon" franchise (1989–1998).

2. Title: Illegal Aliens (novel). Fact: A perfectly spherical white spaceship lands in Central Park to great global excitement, from which Leader Idow, an alien covered in blue fur, claims that his crew represent a Type III civilization that will test Earth's worthiness to be a member planet of their federation. Unbeknownst to the United Nations, the aliens are criminals (the equivalent of juvenile delinquents) who seek out planets with levels of technology similar to Earth's so that they can record the global violence and mayhem that will result from Earth's certain failure for their own prurient interests.

3. Title: Martian. Fact: A Martian is a native inhabitant of the planet Mars. Although the search for evidence of life on Mars continues, many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Mars might be like. Some writers also use the word Martian to describe a human colonist on Mars.

4. Title: Outcasts (TV series). Fact: "Outcasts" is set in the year 2060 on the fictional planet Carpathia, a habitable planet five years travel from Earth. Carpathia has been colonized by a succession of spaceships fleeing destruction and nuclear conflict back on Earth. Most of the planet's population is living within the limits of the pioneer town Forthaven, which was first settled ten years before the time of the beginning of the series. The Carpathians live in ignorance of Earth's fate, receiving news only through the few evacuee transporter ships that successfully pass through the difficult atmospheric entry to Carpathia. Carpathia was so-named by the colonists in honour of the , a ship that came to rescue survivors of the historic disaster.

5. Title: A Patchwork Planet. Fact: The novel is narrated by 30-year-old Barnaby, whose life has gone off the rails since he was caught robbing neighborhood homes as an adolescent. To the despair of his distant father, his social climbing mother, his chilly ex-wife and his prematurely patriarchal brother, Barnaby now works for a company called Rent-a-Back, doing odd jobs for elderly clients.

Question: Ulrich of Eppenstein served as an abbot for an Abbey located in which city in Switzerland ?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Ulrich of Eppenstein. Fact: Ulrich of Eppenstein (?ca.1047–1121) served between 1071 and his death as Abbot of the powerful Abbey of Saint Gall.   Ulrich was prominent as a supporter of Emperor Henry IV during the civil wars that erupted out of the power struggles between the emperor and the papacy during the closing decades of the eleventh century.

2. Title: Abbey of Saint Gall. Fact: The Abbey of Saint Gall (German: Abtei St. Gallen) is a dissolved abbey (747–1805) in a Roman Catholic religious complex in the city of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The Carolingian-era monastery has existed since 719 and became an independent principality between 9th and 13th centuries, and was for many centuries one of the chief Benedictine abbeys in Europe. It was founded by Saint Othmar on the spot where Saint Gall had erected his hermitage. The library at the Abbey is one of the richest medieval libraries in the world. The city of St. Gallen originated as an adjoining settlement of the abbey. Following the secularization of the abbey around 1800 the former Abbey church became a Cathedral in 1848. Since 1983 the whole remaining abbey precinct has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

3. Title: Ulrich of Saint Gall. Fact: Ulrich of Saint Gall may refer to any of eight abbots:

4. Title: Ulrich I, Bishop of Passau. Fact: Ulrich I of Passau, also called Udalrich ( - 7 August 1121, Passau), was a monastery founder and bishop of the diocese of Passau.

5. Title: Ulrich of Bamberg. Fact: Born Udalricus Babenbergensis, he was a cleric of the cathedral church of Bamberg, of whom nothing more is known than that he lived about 1100 at Bamberg. He is probably identical with the priest of Bamberg of the same name (d. 7 July 1127), who is often mentioned in official documents and who bestowed large benefits on the monastery of Michelsberg.

Question: who took a road trip with actress geena davis in 'thelma & louise
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Thelma & Louise. Fact: Thelma & Louise is a 1991 American road film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Callie Khouri. It stars Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise, two friends who embark on a road trip with unforeseen consequences. The supporting cast include Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Brad Pitt in his first major film role.

2. Title: Thelma, Louise et Chantal. Fact: Gabrielle, Nelly and Chantal are three girlfriends. They decide to travel together to the wedding of their ex at La Rochelle. During this trip, they share their blows of heart and rants.

3. Title: Two for the Road (film). Fact: Two for the Road is a 1967 British romantic comedy-drama film directed by Stanley Donen and starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney. Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period.

4. Title: She & Him. Fact: Deschanel and Ward met on the set of the film "The Go-Getter," in which Deschanel had a starring role. Martin Hynes, the director, introduced them to each other and asked them to sing a duet for the film's end credits. They performed the song "When I Get to the Border" by Richard and Linda Thompson. The two bonded over a shared interest in albums produced by George Martin and Phil Spector, as well as certain Ralph Peer groups such as the Carter Family.

5. Title: The Trip (1967 film). Fact: Paul Groves (Peter Fonda), a television commercial director, takes his first dose of LSD while experiencing the heartbreak and ambivalence of divorce from his beautiful but adulterous wife (Susan Strasberg). He starts his trip with a "guide," John (Bruce Dern), but runs away and abandons him out of fear.

Question: What American rapper wrote a song based on a power ballad from Aerosmith's 1973 debut Album?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dream On (Aerosmith song). Fact: "Dream On" is a power ballad by Aerosmith from their 1973 debut album, Aerosmith. Written by lead singer Steven Tyler, this song was their first major hit and became a classic rock radio staple. Released in June 1973, it peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 but hit big in the band's native Boston, where it was the number one single of the year on WBZ-FM, number five for the year on WRKO and number 16 on WMEX (AM).[citation needed] The song received immediate heavy airplay too on the former WVBF (FM), often showing up in the #1 position on "The Top Five At Five" in June 1973.

2. Title: Sing for the Moment. Fact: "Sing for the Moment" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his fourth album The Eminem Show (2002). It was released in February 25, 2003, as the fourth single from The Eminem Show and the final single in the United States. The song samples "Dream On" by American hard rock band Aerosmith.

3. Title: Donnie Iris. Fact: Donnie Iris (born Dominic Ierace on February 28, 1943) is an American rock musician known for his work with the Jaggerz and Wild Cherry during the 1970s, and for his solo career beginning in the 1980s with his band, the Cruisers. He wrote the #2 "Billboard" hit, "The Rapper", with the Jaggerz in 1970 and was a member of Wild Cherry after the group had a #1 hit with "Play That Funky Music." He also achieved fame as a solo artist in the early 1980s with the #29 hit "Ah! Leah!" and the #37 hit "Love Is Like a Rock."

4. Title: Desire (Bob Dylan album). Fact: It is one of Dylan's most collaborative efforts, featuring the same caravan of musicians as the acclaimed Rolling Thunder Revue tours the previous year (later documented on ""). Many of the songs also featured backing vocals by Emmylou Harris and Ronee Blakley. Most of the album was co-written by Jacques Levy, and is composed of lengthy story-songs, two of which quickly generated controversy: the 11-minute-long "Joey", which is seen as glorifying the violent gangster "Crazy Joey" Gallo, and "Hurricane", the opening track that tells a passionate account of the murder case against boxer Rubin Carter, whom the song asserts was framed. Carter was released in 1985, after a judge overturned his conviction on appeal.

5. Title: Energy Crisis '74. Fact: The record is a satire of the 1973 energy crisis in the United States, and was moderately successful; it peaked at #33 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and became the first Top 40 hit for Goodman as a solo artist (Goodman's other records throughout the 1960s had mostly fallen just short of the top 40 and his 1950s works were all collaborations). The record is structured as a series of interviews with various public and political figures of the day with regard to the energy crisis. Questions were asked by an interviewer (Goodman), and their "responses" were snippets of various hit records of the day. The record ends with Goodman saying, "we have just run out of en-er-gyyyyy" as his speech slows to a halt, as if the turntable playing the record had just been shut off.

Question: are there any more grizzly bears in california
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: California grizzly bear. Fact: Less than 75 years after the discovery of gold in 1848, almost every grizzly bear in California had been tracked down and killed. One prospector in Southern California, William F. Holcomb (nicknamed "Grizzly Bill" Holcomb), was particularly well-known for hunting grizzly bears in what is now San Bernardino County. The last hunted California grizzly was shot in Tulare County, California, in August 1922, although no body, skeleton or pelt was ever produced. Two years later in 1924, what was thought to be a grizzly was spotted in Sequoia National Park for the last time, and thereafter, grizzlies were never seen again in California.

2. Title: List of birds of California. Fact: As of June 30, 2019, there are 673 species on this list. Two of these species are endemic, 11 were introduced by humans (directly or indirectly), one species has been extirpated, and one was extirpated in the wild but its reintroduction is in progress. Five additional species have been documented but "the CBRC could not reach a consensus as to whether records of these species involved true naturally occurring vagrants or escapes from captivity." The following tags note species in each of those categories and one additional category:

3. Title: Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park. Fact: Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park is a state park of California, USA, harboring groves of coast redwoods in three separate units along the Van Duzen River.

Cheatham, founder of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, who wanted to preserve the stand of redwoods in perpetuity. Originally established in 1943, the park has grown to . Cheatham Grove , west of the main unit, was added to the park in 1983 due to efforts of the Save the Redwoods League.

4. Title: Leo Carrillo State Park. Fact: The Woolsey Fire was a destructive wildfire that started inland many miles away and raced through canyons and mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties to the coastline. The fire ignited on November 8, 2018 and burned of land. The fire destroyed 1,643 structures, killed three people, and prompted the evacuation of more than 295,000 people. It was one of several fires in California that ignited on the same day.

5. Title: Mariposa Grove. Fact: Mariposa Grove is a sequoia grove located near Wawona, California, United States, in the southernmost part of Yosemite National Park.

Question: rap music and hip-hop culture have their origins in what city
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hip hop. Fact: Hip hop, or hip-hop, is a subculture and art movement developed in the Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s. The origins of the word are often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx. While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (also called rap), hip hop is characterized by nine elements, of which only four elements are considered essential to understand hip-hop musically. The main elements of hip-hop consist of four main pillars. Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: "rapping" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art. Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others. The fifth element is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion or beatboxing however it is often debated.

2. Title: Hip hop and social injustice. Fact: Hip hop music, developed in the South Bronx in the early 1970s, has long been tied to social injustice in the United States of America, particularly that of the African American experience. Hip hop artists in every decade since the genre's inception have spoken out in their lyrics against perceived social injustices such as police brutality, poverty, mass incarceration, and the war on drugs. The relationship between hip hop music and social injustice can be seen most clearly in two subgenres of hip hop, gangsta rap and conscious rap. Hip hop, specifically political hip hop, has been criticized in the past as divisive and promoting separatism due to some hip hop artists' pro-black and anti-establishment lyrical content. Musicologist Robert Walser disputes this, arguing that many white youth who are exposed to hip hop as children are more likely to have positive relationships with African Americans and resist racism from their parents or other sources out of respect for black artists they admire.

3. Title: African hip hop. Fact: Hip hop music has been popular in Africa since the early 1980s due to widespread African American influence. In 1985 hip hop reached Senegal, a French-speaking country in West Africa. Some of the first Senegalese rappers were M.C. Lida, M.C. Solaar, and Positive Black Soul.

4. Title: Chicago hip hop. Fact: The hip hop scene in Chicago, Illinois, has produced many artists of various styles. Famous rappers in Chicago include Twista, Lupe Fiasco, SEVENSIXX, Bump J, Rhymefest, Chief Keef, Cupcakke, Chance the Rapper, Lil Durk, King Louis, Da Brat, Qualo (group), Shawnna, Kanye West, Noname, Fredo Santana, LA Capone, Rondonumbanine, 600Breezy, Young Pappy, Calboy, Common, G Herbo, Lil Bibby, Crucial Conflict, Do or Die, Open Mike Eagle, Jeremih, Juice WRLD, Psychodrama, Juice, Saba, Lud Foe, Smino, Lil Zay Osama, Polo G, and Juice Wrld.

5. Title: Brazilian hip hop. Fact: Brazilian hip hop is a national music genre. From its earliest days in the African-Brazilian communities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the genre has grown into a countrywide phenomena. Rappers, DJs, break dancers and graffiti artists are active across the complete spectrum of society blending Brazil's cultural heritage with American hip hop to form a contemporary musical fusion.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2017–18 AHL season. Fact: Other than the Golden Knights adding a team, there were also reports of the St. Louis Blues adding an expansion team in Kansas City in November 2016. This would later be denied by the announced potential owner in Kansas City, Lamar Hunt Jr., in a press release from his ECHL team in the area, the Missouri Mavericks, and further denied by AHL commissioner, David Andrews, after the January 2017 Board of Governors meeting. In May 2017, the 30 team alignment was confirmed and there would be no expansion for 2017–18. The Golden Knights signed a multi-year affiliation with the Chicago Wolves, replacing the Blues as their primary affiliate.

2. Title: St. Louis Blues. Fact: The St. Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team based in St. Louis, Missouri.

The Blues play their home games at the 19,150-seat Enterprise Center in downtown St. Louis, which has been their arena since moving from St. Louis Arena in 1994.

3. Title: American Hockey League.

Question: What kind of stick is Eric Boguniecki holding?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Pick-up sticks. Fact: Pick-up sticks or pick-a-stick is a game of physical and mental skill in which a bundle of "sticks", between 8 and 20 centimeters long, are dropped as a loose bunch onto a table top, jumbling into a random pile. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others. The game is known by several names including jackstraws (or jack straws), spellicans, and spillikins, and appears in a line of a nursery rhyme: "...five, six, pick-up sticks!"

2. Title: Stickum. Fact: Stickum is a trademark adhesive of Mueller Sports Medicine, of Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, United States. It is available in powder, paste, and aerosol spray forms. According to the company website, the spray form is "excellent for bat handles and vaulting poles." Many vendors also promote the product for use by weightlifters, and for various other athletic applications.

3. Title: Pogo stick. Fact: It consists of a pole with a handle at the top and footrests near the bottom, and a spring located somewhere along the pole. The spring joins two sections of the pole, which extends below the footpads.

4. Title: Clifton McNeil. Fact: Clifton Anthony McNeil (born May 25, 1940 in Mobile, Alabama), aka "The Stick," is a former professional American football player in the National Football League from 1964 through 1973. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the eleventh round in the 1962 NFL Draft out of Grambling State University. He played with the Browns for four seasons before being traded to the San Francisco 49ers in 1968 for a draft pick.

5. Title: Stickum. Fact: Stickum, along with other adhesive or "sticky" substances (such as glue, rosin (tree sap), or food substances), were used for years in the National Football League to assist players in gripping the ball. The use of adhesives such as Stickum was banned by the league in 1981, and the resulting action became known as the "Lester Hayes rule" in association with the Oakland Raiders defensive back known for his widespread use of Stickum. Despite the ban, Hall of Famer Jerry Rice freely admitted to illegally using Stickum throughout his career, leading many fans to question the integrity of his receiving records. Rice's claim that "all players" in his era used Stickum was quickly denied by Hall of Fame contemporaries Cris Carter and Michael Irvin.

1. Title: Daisy Buchanan. Fact: Daisy Fay was born into a wealthy Louisville family. By 1917, Daisy had several suitors of her same class, but fell in love with Jay Gatsby, a poor soldier. Before Gatsby left for war, Daisy promised to wait for him. After Gatsby started attending Trinity College, Oxford, Daisy sent him a letter revealing that she had married Tom Buchanan. During the marriage, Daisy gave birth to a daughter, Pammy, who Daisy had hoped would be "a beautiful little fool." Daisy and her family settled in East Egg, a wealthy old money enclave in Long Island.

2. Title: Frances Scott Fitzgerald. Fact: Fitzgerald was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Upon her birth, her mother supposedly remarked that she hoped Scottie would be a "beautiful little fool," which Daisy Buchanan also says in "The Great Gatsby", F. Scott Fitzgerald's best known novel. Scottie Fitzgerald spent her childhood moving from place to place with her parents – including time spent living in Paris and Antibes in France, and for five years in a beach house her father rented on the coast of the Chesapeake Bay not far from Baltimore, Maryland. She attended Calvert School and briefly attended the Bryn Mawr School while her mother Zelda received treatment at Sheppard Pratt Hospital.

3. Title: Lucy Johnston Sypher. Fact: The books describe the author's life early in Wales, as the daughter of George Henry (known as Harry), the town banker, and Caroline, a church organist and music teacher from a cultured, well-educated, big-city family. In the books, eleven-year-old Lucy attends a small country school and befriends the three daughters of an emigrant English family and their spoiled brother, who is nicknamed "The Prince of Wales" (punning upon his tendency to cry easily and the name of the town.) She visits her big-city cousins and is irritated by her mischievous older brother, Amory. The final book, "The Turnabout Year", describes her mother's difficult recovery after the birth of her younger brother, George, and Lucy's decision to attend high school in Minneapolis.

4. Title: The Grand Sophy. Fact: For the past several years Sophia Stanton-Lacy (known as Sophy to everyone) has lived away from England, following her diplomat father Sir Horace around Europe while the Napoleonic Wars raged on. Now that the Battle of Waterloo is over and Napoleon has once again been exiled, her father receives a temporary post in South America. Instead of taking his daughter with him to the new continent, he asks his sister, Lady Ombersley, to watch over his "little Sophy" and help find her a husband. However, "little Sophy" is nothing like anyone expected. 5'9" in her stockings and quite used to getting her own way after a lifetime in a household with no mother, no governess, and wartime liberties, she is outgoing, chic, and quite independent, taking the town by storm with her unconventional manner.

5. Title: Ginevra King. Fact: Ginevra King Pirie (November 30, 1898 – December 13, 1980) was an American socialite, debutante and heiress. She was the inspiration for several characters in the novels and short stories of American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, in particular, the character of Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby". King and Fitzgerald shared a youthful romance, but their relationship stagnated after King's father warned the young writer that "poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls." Scholars regard King as a "prototype of the aloof, upper-crust woman who is popular and rich and for [Fitzgerald] becomes an archetype" of "the American dream." King's first husband, William Mitchell—whom she later divorced after an unhappy marriage—served as the model for Tom Buchanan in the same novel.

Question: when was texas annexed by the united states
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Texas annexation. Fact: The Texas Annexation was the 1845 incorporation of the Republic of Texas into the United States of America, which was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29, 1845.

2. Title: History of Texas (1845–1860). Fact: Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the Compromise of 1850, in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.

3. Title: History of Texas (1845–1860). Fact: In 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States of America, becoming the 28th U.S. state. Border disputes between the new state and Mexico, which had never recognized Texas independence and still considered the area a renegade Mexican state, led to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). When the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States.

4. Title: History of Texas (1865–99). Fact: Following the defeat of the Confederate States in the American Civil War, Texas was mandated to rejoin the United States of America. Union Army soldiers officially occupied the state starting on June 19, 1865; the date is now commemorated as the holiday Juneteenth, recognizing the official emancipation of slaves in the state. For the next nine years, Texas was governed by a series of provisional governors as the state went through Reconstruction. Texas fully rejoined the United States in 1901, with a new state constitution approved in 1903.

5. Title: Republic of Texas. Fact: The Republic of Texas  was a sovereign nation  in North America that existed from March 2, 1836, to February 19, 1846. It was bordered by Mexico to the west and southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast, the two U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast, and United States territories encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico to the north and west. The citizens of the republic were known as Texians.

Question: can a minor be given the death penalty in texas
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Capital punishment in Texas. Fact: Under Texas law, offenders under 17 are not executed but the US Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons has ruled capital punishment to be unconstitional for those under 18 when the crime was committed. The victim's age under which child murder is punishable by death was raised from six to 10 in 2011 by the Texas legislature.

2. Title: Felony murder rule (Texas). Fact: Texas's felony murder rule, codified in Texas Penal Code § 19.02(b)(3), states that a person commits murder if he "commits or attempts to commit a felony, other than manslaughter, and in the course of and in furtherance of the commission or attempt, or in immediate flight from the commission or attempt, he commits or attempts to commit an act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual."

3. Title: List of people executed in Texas, 2010–19. Fact: The following is a list of people executed by the U.S. state of Texas between 2010 and 2019. All of the 120 individuals (117 males and 3 females) during this period were convicted of murder and have been executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, Texas.

4. Title: List of people executed in Texas, 2010–19. Fact: The number in the "#" column indicates the "n"th person executed since 1982 (when Texas resumed the death penalty). As an example, Kenneth Mosley (the first person executed in Texas during the 2010 decade) was the 448th person executed since resumption of the death penalty.

5. Title: List of people executed in Texas, 2000–09. Fact: The following is a list of people executed by the U.S. state of Texas between 2000 and 2009. All of the 248 individuals (246 males and 2 females) during this period were convicted of murder and have been executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, Texas. The count is the most of any decade in Texas history, surpassing the 166 executions from the previous decade (1990–1999).

Question: true or false. you can ride an icebreaker to the north pole
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Polar Sun Spire. Fact: Polar Sun Spire is a peak in Beluga Mountain in the Sam Ford Fjord of Baffin Island, Canada. The spire is notable for its spectacular north face and has been the scene of some amazing epic climbs. The first ascent was made in 1996 by Mark Synnott, Jeff Chapman and Warren Hollinger and involved a tremendous effort. The team spent a full month on the climb and summited after 36 consecutive nights in a portaledge. They encountered difficulties up to A4 and named their 34-pitch route "The Great and Secret Show." A Norwegian team established another impressive line in 2000.

2. Title: Icebreaker. Fact: Canada's largest and most powerful icebreaker, the 120-metre (390 ft) CCGS Louis S. St. Laurent, was delivered in 1969. Her original 3 steam turbine/9 generator/ 3 electric motor system produces 27,000*shaft horsepower. A multi-year mid-life refit project (1987-1993) saw the ship get a new bow, and a new propulsion system. The new power plant consists of 5 diesels/ 3 generators/ 3 electric motors giving about the same SHP. On 22 August 1994 Louis S. St-Laurent and USCGC Polar Sea became the first North American surface vessels to reach the North Pole. The vessel was originally scheduled to be decommissioned in 2000 however a refit extended the decommissioning date to 2017.

3. Title: Snowspeed. Fact: Snowspeed is gravity powered snow sledge that has been designed to beat the world speed record.

4. Title: False peak. Fact: In mountaineering, a false peak or false summit is a peak that appears to be the pinnacle of the mountain but upon reaching, it turns out the summit is higher. False peaks can have significant effects on climbers' psychological states by inducing feelings of dashed hopes or even failure. The term "false peak" can also be applied to non-mountaineering activities where obstacles posing as the end goal produce the same psychological effects.

5. Title: Janice Meek. Fact: Janice (Jan) Meek - personal motto - 'not why - why not' .. (maiden name Janice Cooper, first married name Janice Byles) FRGS (British, born 1944) is a Guinness World Record holding adventurer, ocean rower, international motivational speaker polar racer and explorer..

Question: where do penguins live north pole or south pole
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Penguin. Fact: Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands.

2. Title: Emperor penguin. Fact: The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, emperor penguins trek over the ice to breeding colonies which can contain up to several thousand individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age.

3. Title: Penguin Island (Western Australia). Fact: Penguin Island is a island off the coast near Perth, Western Australia, approximately from Rockingham. It is home to a colony of approximately little penguins, the largest population of the birds in Western Australia. The waters surrounding the island make up the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park.

4. Title: St Andrews Bay, South Georgia. Fact: King penguins form huge breeding colonies - and the one at St Andrews Bay has 150,000 birds. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously occupied.

5. Title: Little penguin. Fact: The little penguin ("Eudyptula minor") is the smallest species of penguin. It grows to an average of in height and in length, though specific measurements vary by subspecies. It is found on the coastlines of southern Australia and New Zealand, with possible records from Chile. In Australia, they are often called fairy penguins because of their small size. In New Zealand, they are more commonly known as little blue penguins or blue penguins owing to their slate-blue plumage; they are also known by their Māori name: kororā.

Question: who committed the first act of war in the 1967 six day war conflict
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Origins of the Six-Day War. Fact: In April 1967, Syria shot at an Israeli tractor ploughing in the demilitarized zone, which escalated to a prewar aerial clash. In May 1967, following misinformation about Israeli intentions provided by the Soviet Union, Egypt expelled UN peacekeepers who had been stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since the Suez conflict, and announced a blockade of Israel's access to the Red Sea (international waters) via the Straits of Tiran, which Israel considered an act of war. Tension escalated, with both sides' armies mobilising. Less than a month later, Israel launched a surprise strike which began the Six-Day War.

2. Title: Six-Day War (2000). Fact: The Six-Day War  was a series of armed confrontations between Ugandan and Rwandan forces around the city of Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 5 to 10 June 2000. The war formed part of the wider Second Congo War (1998–2003).

3. Title: Six-Day War (1899). Fact: The Six-Day War of 1899 was fought between the British Empire and the major punti clans of the New Territories in Hong Kong on 14–19 April 1899. The British quickly and decisively ended armed resistance, but to prevent future resistance made concessions to placate the indigenous inhabitants. Despite losing to the better equipped British military, they achieved their ultimate goal which was to preserve their land rights, land use, and traditional customs. The special status and rights of the minority indigenous people of Hong Kong are extant to this day. The battle resulted in two wounded on the British side and about 500 dead on the Chinese side.

4. Title: Black September. Fact: The Black September (; "Aylūl Al-Aswad") was a conflict fought in Jordan between the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF), under the leadership of King Hussein, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, primarily between 16 and 27 September 1970, with certain actions continuing until 17 July 1971.

5. Title: Six-Day War (2000). Fact: Kisangani was also a scene of violence between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in August 1999 and 5 May 2000. However, the conflicts of June 2000 were the most lethal and seriously damaged a large part of the city, with more than 6,600 rounds fired.

Question: can you buy alcohol on your 21st birthday in kentucky
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Alcohol laws of Kentucky. Fact: Another inconsistency involves the difference between legal ages for buying and selling alcoholic beverages. The legal age for purchase is 21, as in all U.S. states. However, the legal age for selling or serving alcoholic beverages in a licensed establishment is 20. In the case of packaged beer, the legal selling age is 18, as long as the person is supervised by someone who is at least 20.

2. Title: Shoulder tap (alcohol). Fact: A shoulder tap is an act in which a minor asks an adult to purchase alcohol for him or her. The definition of minor and adult vary by jurisdiction depending on the drinking age, but is usually between ages 18–21. Typically, the minor will walk around a convenience store and solicit help from a passing adult stranger. This is also commonly known as a "Hey Mister". A Los Angeles Police Department survey indicated that almost half of minors who attempt to acquire alcohol use this

3. Title: Gun laws in Kentucky. Fact: Kentucky's concealed carry law, set forth in KRS § 237.110, is "shall-issue". The law is written to allow the carry of concealed "deadly weapons", not just handguns. Although Kentucky allows concealed carry without a permit for those 21 and over, permits are still issued. The permit is called a Concealed Deadly Weapons License (CDWL). The definition of a "deadly weapon", found in KRS § 500.080, includes a wide array of weapons other than guns, including knives (ordinary pocket knives or hunting knives are specifically classified as not being "deadly weapons"), clubs, blackjacks, nunchaku, shuriken, and brass knuckles (including knuckles made from other hard materials). All CDWLs are issued for 5 years. Only Kentucky residents are eligible to apply for and obtain the permit

4. Title: Alcohol laws of Texas. Fact: A person must be at least be 21 years of age to publicly drink an alcoholic beverage in Texas, with some exceptions

5. Title: Alcohol laws of Indiana. Fact: Effective July 4, 2010, beer sold in microbreweries may be sold on Sundays pursuant to Senate Bill 75. The sales must take place where the brewing is done. However, off-site sales may take place in trade shows and similar back door events. The sales limit is two cases per person, or 576 ounces.

Question: What was the year of birth of the mathematician that is credited with developing infinitesimal calculus and using Jean Picard's measurement of earth to create his theory of universal gravitation?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jean Picard. Fact: Jean-Félix Picard (21 July 1620 – 12 July 1682) was a French astronomer and priest born in La Flèche, where he studied at the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand. He died in Paris, France. He was the first person to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in a survey conducted in 1669–70, for which he is honored with a pyramid at Juvisy-sur-Orge. Guided by Maurolycus's methodology and Snellius's mathematics for doing so, Picard achieved this by measuring one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. The polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. This was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography. Picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires (developed by William Gascoigne) to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a micrometer screw on his instruments. The quadrant he used to determine the size of the Earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter-minutes. The sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. These equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to Tycho Brahe's four minutes of error. This made his measurements 24 times as accurate. Isaac Newton was to use this value in his theory of universal gravitation.

2. Title: Mathesis universalis. Fact: Mathesis universalis (Greek μάθησις, "mathesis" "science or learning", Latin "universalis" "universal") is a hypothetical universal science modeled on mathematics envisaged by Descartes and Leibniz, among a number of more minor 16th and 17th century philosophers and mathematicians. John Wallis invokes the name as the title to a textbook on Cartesian geometry. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a calculus ratiocinator.

3. Title: Leonhard Euler. Fact: Leonhard Euler ( ; ; 15 April 170718 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics, such as infinitesimal calculus and graph theory, while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy and music theory.

4. Title: Isaac Newton. Fact: Sir Isaac Newton PRS (/ˈnjuːtən/; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian and physicist (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution.  His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics.  Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.

5. Title: Johann Bernoulli. Fact: Johann Bernoulli (also known as Jean or John; – 1 January 1748) was a Swiss mathematician and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family. He is known for his contributions to infinitesimal calculus and educating Leonhard Euler in the pupil's youth.

Question: is a mule a cross between a donkey and a horse
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Mule. Fact: A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes. Of the two F1 hybrids (first generation hybrids) between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny, which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion).

2. Title: Mule (sheep). Fact: In sheep farming, the term mule is used to refer to a cross between a lowland ram (usually a Bluefaced Leicester) and a purebred hill (or mountain) ewe.

3. Title: The Horse and the Donkey. Fact: The Horse and the Donkey is a variant of a fable type recorded since antiquity of which there is scarcely one version that concerns the same pair of animals. Included as one of Aesop's Fables and numbered 181 in the Perry Index, its Greek sources also include a donkey and a mule, while the story is told of an ox and a donkey in the Mediaeval Latin version of Ademar. In the former the overburdened donkey asks its companion for help in carrying its load and dies when this is refused; the other is then forced to carry not only the original load but the dead animal's skin as well. In Ademar's story the two animals are yoked together but the ass refuses to pull its weight; when the ox dies of the strain, the ass is forced to continue pulling and also dies.

4. Title: Hinny. Fact: A hinny is a domestic equine hybrid that is the offspring of a male horse (a stallion) and a female donkey (a jenny). It is the reciprocal cross to the more common mule, which is the product of a male donkey, a jack, and a female horse, a mare. The hinny is distinctive from the mule both in physiology and temperament as a consequence of genomic imprinting.

5. Title: Donkey. Fact: A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet; a young donkey is a foal. Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules; the biological "reciprocal" of a mule, from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead, is called a hinny.

Question: the primary colors of pigment are cyan yellow and magenta true or false
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shades of cyan. Fact: The color cyan, a greenish-blue, has notable tints and shades. It is one of the subtractive primary colors- cyan, magenta, and yellow.

2. Title: Cyan. Fact: In the subtractive color system, or CMYK (subtractive), which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black. In the additive color system, or RGB (additive) color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light.

3. Title: Yellow. Fact: Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570590 nm. It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage. Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when sun is near a horizon, due to atmosphere scattering shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet).

4. Title: Cyan. Fact: Cyan (, ) is a greenish-blue color. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of between 490520 nm, between the wavelengths of green and blue.

5. Title: Magenta. Fact: Magenta  is a color that is variously defined as purplish-red, reddish-purple or mauvish-crimson. On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, it is located midway between red and blue. It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by an inkjet printer, along with yellow, black, and cyan, to make all the other colors. The tone of magenta used in printing is called "printer's magenta".

Question: What yellow assistance item is located just inside the door of the Gillig Low Floor?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Illumibowl. Fact: IllumiBowl is a motion-activated night light that fits on the rim of any toilet. It illuminates the inner bowl anytime that a person approaches the bathroom in the dark.

2. Title: Subsidy Password. Fact: The term Subsidy Password is used by Motorola and other handset manufacturers to refer to the 8-digit (or 16-digit code for newer phones such as the Motorola K1) unlock code necessary to remove the operator lock (also known as subsidy lock) from cell phones. This code is randomly assigned to individual cell phones by the OEM on request of the mobile service operator and prevents the use of a particular phone on a cellular network other than that to which the phone was originally sold.

3. Title: Forward assist. Fact: The forward assist on a firearm is a button found commonly on AR-15 rifle derivatives, such as the M16 rifle, and is usually located near the bolt closure. When hit, it pushes the bolt carrier forward, ensuring that the bolt is locked. In order to ensure that the extractor is clipped around the rim of the casing, the forward assist is usually struck rather than pushed. It is commonly incorporated into standard loading procedure to prepare a firearm for firing, or to close the bolt when the firearm is excessively dirty.

4. Title: Butterworth Cover. Fact: A Butterworth cover (also Butterworth hatch and Butterworth plate) is a hatch on the deck of a cargo vessel that is used to seal a small opening that admits to the space below.

5. Title: The Forgotten Latchkey. Fact: Mr. and Mrs. Burton are staying at the residence of their friends the Moores. The Moores leave to visit Mrs. Moore's mother, and leave a key for the Burtons, who are going out to a dance. Mrs. Burton forgets to take the key with her, and upon their return to the Moore residence, find that they are unable to gain entry, nor are they able to rouse the slumberous maid Bridget. They attempt to enter the house through the cellar, but the door to the kitchen is locked. Further attempts to rouse the maid are futile. They attempt to go to a hotel, but are not admitted. The Burtons end up hiring a taxicab and spending the night in the car, as it is too frigid to walk around outdoors. When the Moore's cook arrives at the house the next morning, she finds the Burtons asleep in the taxi, and believes them to be deceased. Her screams awake the Burtons, and they are finally admitted to the inside of the residence, but not before paying the taxi driver $17.

Question: What is the silver thing that is latched onto the tank in Diesel fuel?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oil catch tank. Fact: During normal operation of a car engine, some vapors from the cylinder pass by the piston rings and down into the crank case. Without ventilation this can pressurize the crank case and cause issues such as lack of piston ring sealing and damaged oil seals.

2. Title: Oil catch tank. Fact: An oil catch tank (oil catch can) is a device that is fitted into the cam/crank case ventilation system on a car. Installing an oil catch tank (can) aims to reduce the amount of oil vapors re-circulated into the intake of the engine.

3. Title: Nixie tube. Fact: The glass tube contains a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols. Applying power to one cathode surrounds it with an orange glow discharge. The tube is filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly neon and often a little mercury or argon, in a Penning mixture.

4. Title: Ejection charge. Fact: Ejection charge (commonly Black Power), also called expelling charge, is a pyrotechnic composition, a type of a pyrotechnic gas generator designed to produce a small short-term amount of thrust to burst open a container and eject its content.

5. Title: M44 (cyanide device). Fact: The M44 cyanide device (also called a cyanide gun or cyanide trap) is used for the killing of coyotes, feral dogs, and foxes. It is made from four parts: a capsule holder wrapped with cloth or other soft material, a small plastic capsule containing 0.88 grams of sodium cyanide, a spring-powered ejector, and a 5-7 inch stake. To install the trap, the stake is first driven down into the ground, and then the capsule is put in the holder, screwed onto the cocked ejector, and secured to the stake. The wrapped capsule holder is smeared with scented bait to attract coyotes and make them bite and pull on it. (The use of a bite-and-pull action makes the trap less likely to be set off by non-canine wildlife.) When the trap is triggered, the spring propels a dose of sodium cyanide into the animals's mouth, and the sodium cyanide combines with water in the mouth to produce poisonous cyanide gas.

1. Title: Jack Pumpkinhead. Fact: Jack first appeared as a main character in the second Oz book by Baum "The Marvelous Land of Oz" (1904). Jack's incredibly tall and skinny figure is made from tree limbs and jointed with wooden pegs. He has a large carved jack-o'-lantern for a head which is where he gets his name (unlike most jack-o'-lanterns, the seeds and other pumpkin guts were not removed so it substitutes for his brain).

2. Title: Wizard (Archie Comics). Fact: His real name is Blane Whitney, a man of great intelligence. He descends from a long line of men who fought for America in its wars, including General Steven Whitney who was General Washington's chief aide in the Revolutionary War (and it was later retroactively revealed that Blane was not the first Whitney to defend his country wearing the red mask and cloak of the Wizard during key events in early U.S. history). At age 14, Blane met President Woodrow Wilson, who told him to use his brain only for good and not for evil. While in college, he was a superb athlete and student. His brother Grover, chief of the Naval Intelligence Service, usually informed him of enemy plots against America. To aid him in his fight against these enemies, the Wizard had various contraptions and machines of his own design available to him, like a vibra-ray gun and a car that could reach up to 500 mph. He had several devices that enabled him to fly. Coming from a rich family, he also had airplanes and submarines at his disposal.

3. Title: Jack Brown Genius. Fact: The brain of inventor Jack Brown is possessed by the soul of a medieval monk who thinks he knows the secret of how to fly.

4. Title: The Great Brain. Fact: The Great Brain is a series of children's books by American author John Dennis Fitzgerald (1906–1988). Set in the small town of Adenville, Utah, between 1896 and 1898, the stories are loosely based on Fitzgerald's childhood experiences. Chronicled by the first-person voice of John Dennis Fitzgerald, the stories mainly center on the escapades of John's mischievous older brother, Tom Dennis Fitzgerald, a.k.a. "The Great Brain". "The Great Brain" was made into a movie released in 1978, with the main character played by Jimmy Osmond.

5. Title: The Mouse and the Monster. Fact: During what would be his final concert, the brilliant pianist Flatnoteski suffered a heart attack and died. Among the front-row visitors were Dr. Wackerstein and his wife and assistant Olga. Dr. Wackerstein immediately claimed Flatnoteski's brain so that the Doctor could create a body to place said brain in and allow Flatnoteski's genius to live on. For this purpose, Dr. Wackerstein created Mo, a cycloptic golem bearing a passing resemblance to Frankenstein's Monster. However, even without a brain, Mo had a mind and personality of his own and did not want his own newly created life to make room for a brain that wasn't his. An inhabitant of Wackerstein's castle, a mouse named Chesbro, befriended Mo and helped him to flee. Pals together, they are on the run from the mad doctor.

1. Title: Games for Windows – Live. Fact: Games for Windows – Live or GFWL (trademarked as Games for Windows – LIVE) is an online gaming service used by Games for Windows–branded PC titles that enables Windows PCs to connect to Microsoft's Live service. Users, each with a unique Gamertag (the Microsoft username service for gaming that began on Xbox Live), are able to play online, keep track of their friends' status, send and receive messages, gain and keep track of Achievements and associated Gamerscore, voice chat across platforms (removed in 2010), and much more. Some games allow for cross-platform play, such as Shadowrun, putting Windows players against Xbox 360 players.

2. Title: Shadowrun (2007 video game). Fact: Shadowrun is a first-person shooter video game, developed by FASA Studio for Xbox 360 and Windows Vista. It was later cracked to work on Windows XP, confirming speculation that it was intentionally limited to Windows Vista.

3. Title: Xbox Live Indie Games. Fact: Xbox Live Indie Games (abbreviated as XBLIG, and previously called Xbox Live Community Games abbreviated as XBLCG) are video games created by individual developers or small teams of developers released on Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace for the Xbox 360. The games were developed using Microsoft XNA, and developed by one or more independent developers that are registered with App Hub. Unlike Xbox Live Arcade titles, these were generally only tested within the local creator community, had much lower costs of production, and generally were less expensive to purchase. The service was released to widespread use alongside the New Xbox Experience, and , over 3,300 games have been released on the service, many receiving media attention. All Indie Games currently require the user to be logged into their Xbox Live account to initiate the start-up of each game. Indie Games were not available in Australia, due to the requirement for all games to be rated by the Australian Classification Board, and the prohibitive expenses involved.

4. Title: Xbox Live. Fact: The service was extended in 2007 on the Windows platform, named Games for Windows – Live, which makes most aspects of the system available on Windows computers. Microsoft has announced plans to extend Live to other platforms such as handhelds and mobile phones as part of the Live Anywhere initiative.

The service shut down for the original Xbox on April 15, 2010, and original Xbox Games are now only playable online through local area network (LAN) tunneling applications such as XLink Kai.

5. Title: PlayOnline. Fact: PlayOnline is an online gaming service created by Square (now Square Enix) on January 28, 2000, and has been the launcher application and Internet service for many of the online PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 games the company publishes.

As of 2018, the PC version of "Final Fantasy XI" is the only remaining game supported by the service.

Its opening coincided with the debut of the newly-revamped Pixar Pier section of the park, where the roller coaster is located. The tubes the coaster shoots through serve two purposes: concealing scenes with The Incredibles characters, and meeting the sound restrictions of Orange County, California. In one tube, an overwhelming smell of chocolate chip cookies references Jack-Jack's obsession with chocolate chip cookies in Incredibles 2. Additionally, the tubes open up toward Pixar Pier allowing people in the park to see riders moving through the coaster. However, the backside of these tubes are closed in order to meet sound code in Orange County, California, projecting the screams of the riders toward the park and away from the rest of the city of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove.

Question: who won the space race to the moon
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Space Race. Fact: The Space Race began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite "in the near future". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957, orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The "race" peaked with the July 20, 1969, US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed crewed lunar missions, and eventually canceled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations.

2. Title: Race to Space. Fact: The film takes place during the 1960s space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.

3. Title: Space race (disambiguation). Fact: The Space Race was a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to explore outer space.

4. Title: Timeline of the Space Race. Fact: This is a timeline of first achievements in spaceflight from the first intercontinental ballistic missile through the first multinational human-crewed mission—spanning the era of the Space Race. Two days after the United States announced its intention to launch an artificial satellite, on July 31, 1956, the Soviet Union announced its intention to do the same. Sputnik 1 was launched on October 4, 1957, beating the United States and stunning people all over the world.

5. Title: Apollo 17. Fact: Apollo 17 (December 7–19, 1972) was the final mission of NASA's Apollo program; it remains the most recent time humans have travelled beyond low Earth orbit. Its crew consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan, Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt, and Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans, and it carried a biological experiment containing five mice.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: La Tante DC10 Restaurant. Fact: La Tante DC10 Restaurant, known locally as The Green Plane, is a public private partnership restaurant established in Accra.

3. Title: Fly540.

Question: who did nbc send to the 2014 winter olympics
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters. Fact: In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a US$4.38 billion contract with NBC Sports, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020 (with broadcast rights to Sochi valued at US$775 million alone). As it did during the 2012 Summer Olympics (which brought strong viewership, and ultimately turned a profit of $88 million, unlike the previous Winter Olympics, which resulted in a loss of US$223 million), NBC offered live and tape-delayed coverage of events on television across its free-to-air network and a number of pay TV channels, and provided streaming of all events online and on mobile platforms to those who subscribe to the channels on participating pay television providers. ESPN and Fox Sports made competing bids for 2014 and 2016 Games only, but were outbid by NBC.

2. Title: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters. Fact: The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi will be televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, Olympic Broadcasting Services will produce the world feed provided to local broadcasters for use in their coverage. In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics were packaged together, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well, while in Australia, the 2014 Games were offered individually after all three major networks were unable to reach a deal for both.

3. Title: NBC Olympic broadcasts. Fact: This time, some events that traditionally draw higher ratings were first aired live on one of NBC's sister cable networks (such as NBCSN), and then a tape-delayed version was broadcast on NBC in primetime. For coverage of the popular figure skating events, there were two sets of commentators: Terry Gannon, Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir announced NBCSN's live broadcast; and Tom Hammond, Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic anchored the tape-delayed coverage on NBC. Invariably, comparisons were made between the two announcing teams; the NBCSN team of Weir and Lipinksi received critical acclaim, and were promoted to NBC's lead figure skating analysts.

4. Title: CBC Olympic broadcasts. Fact: The broadcasts of Summer and Winter Olympic Games produced by CBC Sports is shown on CBC Television and heard on CBC's radio networks in Canada. CBC was the broadcaster of the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Olympics.

5. Title: NHL on NBC. Fact: The NHL on NBC is a presentation of National Hockey League (NHL) games that are produced by NBC Sports, and televised on NBC and NBCSN in the United States. While NBC has covered the league at various points in its history, the network's current relationship with the NHL is the result of NBC Sports acquiring the league's broadcast television rights from ABC in 2005. Its current contract with the league runs until 2021.

Question: has hungary ever been in the world cup
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hungary at the FIFA World Cup. Fact: Hungary have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on nine occasions, the first being at the 1934 where they reached the quarter-final. They have been runners-up on two occasions, in 1938 and 1954. They have failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup since 1986.

2. Title: Hungary at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Fact: Hungary was in Group 4 of UEFA's World Cup qualifications. They played alongside England, Romania, Switzerland and Norway. Hungary finished as top in the group and qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

3. Title: Hungary at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Fact: Hungary was in Group 9 of UEFA's World Cup qualifications. They played alongside Soviet Union and Greece.

4. Title: Hungary national football team. Fact: Hungary has a respectable football history, having won three Olympic titles, finishing runners-up in the 1938 and 1954 World Cups, and third in the 1964 UEFA European Football Championship. Hungary revolutionized the sport in the 1950s, laying the tactical fundamentals of Total Football and dominating international football with the remarkable Golden Team which included legend Ferenc Puskás, top goalscorer of the 20th century, to whom FIFA dedicated its newest award, the Puskás Award. The side of that era has the all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in the world, with 2230 in 1954, and one of the longest undefeated runs in football history, remaining unbeaten in 31 games, spanning over four years and including matches such as the Match of the Century.

5. Title: Football in Hungary. Fact: The Hungarian Football Federation ( or MLSZ), the sport's national governing body, was founded in 1901. Hungary were regular features at major tournaments, such as the first Olympic Football Tournament (Stockholm 1912) and many FIFA World Cup. They were the first non-UK team to beat England at Wembley Stadium with their 6-3 victory in 1953. The golden age of Hungarian football took place in the 1950s, with the emergence of players of the caliber of Ferenc Puskás, László Kubala, Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis, Nándor Hidegkuti, Ferenc Szusza, József Bozsik & Gyula Grosics. This team (with the exception of Kubala, who only played 3 games with Hungary before playing for Spain) was known as the Golden Team and remained undefeated for 32 consecutive games, winning the gold medal in the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki and reaching the final in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, always with Ferenc Puskás as a star (84 goals in 85 matches playing for the Hungarian national football team). The twilight of this team that marveled the world came with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and after a match of the European Champion's Cup Budapest Honvéd in Bilbao, many of the stars like Czibor, Kocsis and Puskás decided not to return to their country and sign for teams from Western Europe, meaning his retirement from the national team. Puskás joined Real Madrid in 1958, winning three European Cups and debuting with the Spanish national team in 1961, while Czibor and Kocsis joined FC Barcelona. In 1967, the Ferencváros T.C. Flórián Albert became the first Hungarian to win the Golden Ball, surpassing the second place achieved by Puskás seven years before.

Question: Was "Seventeen" or "Cosmogirl" published first?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Seventeen (American magazine). Fact: Seventeen is an American magazine for teenagers. The magazine's reader base is 13-to-19-year-old females. It began as a publication geared towards inspiring teen girls to become model workers and citizens. Soon after its debut, Seventeen took a more fashion and romance-oriented approach in presenting its material while promoting self-confidence in young women. It was first published in September 1944 by Walter Annenberg's Triangle Publications.

2. Title: Cosmogirl. Fact: CosmoGirl was an American magazine based in New York City, published from 1999 until 2008. The teenage spin-off of Cosmopolitan magazine, it targeted teenage girls and featured fashion and celebrities. It was published ten times a year and reached approximately eight million readers before folding. The last issue was December 2008. Subscribers instead received issues of fellow Hearst publication, Seventeen.

3. Title: Fifteen (novel). Fact: Fifteen is a juvenile fiction novel written by Beverly Cleary. It was first published in 1956. It chronicles the perspective of a teenage girl entering her first romantic relationship. The book captures the innocent spirit of life in the 1950s, both through the playfully light storyline and the casual references to convertibles, sweaters, "meeting boys", and soda shops. Regardless, the book remains in print today because its overall theme of difficult adolescent feelings still connects with young readers.

4. Title: Seventeen (Tarkington novel). Fact: The middle-class Baxter family enjoys a comfortable and placid life until the summer when their neighbors, the Parcher family, play host to an out-of-town visitor, Lola Pratt. An aspiring actress, Lola is a "howling belle of eighteen" who talks baby-talk "even at breakfast" and holds the center of attention wherever she goes. She instantly captivates William with her beauty, her flirtatious manner, and her ever-present prop, a tiny white lap dog, Flopit. William is sure he has found True Love at Last. Like the other youths of his circle, he spends the summer pursuing Lola at picnics, dances and evening parties, inadvertently making himself obnoxious to his family and friends. They, in turn, constantly embarrass and humiliate him as they do not share his exalted opinion of his "babytalk lady".

5. Title: Juvenile Miscellany. Fact: The magazine was founded in 1826 by Lydia Maria Child. She supervised its bimonthly publication between September 1826 and August 1834. Child's interest in abolitionism and the publication in 1833 of her antislavery book, "An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans", led to Child being socially shunned. Subscriptions to the magazine dropped off. Child left her editorial position.

Fact: The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, abbreviated as the C&O Canal and occasionally called the "Grand Old Ditch," operated from 1831 until 1924 along the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., to Cumberland, Maryland. The canal's principal cargo was coal from the Allegheny Mountains.

2. Title: Miami Canal. Fact: The Miami Canal, or C-6 Canal, flows from Lake Okeechobee in the U.S. state of Florida to its terminus at the Miami River, which flows through downtown Miami. The canal flows in a south and southeasterly direction for approximately 77 miles, and passes through three counties: Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade. It was constructed in the early part of the 20th century to drain the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA).

3. Title: Forth and Clyde Canal. Fact: The Forth and Clyde Canal is a canal opened in 1790, crossing central Scotland; it provided a route for the seagoing vessels of the day between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde at the narrowest part of the Scottish Lowlands. It is long and it runs from the River Carron at Grangemouth to the River Clyde at Bowling, and had an important basin at Port Dundas in Glasgow.

4. Title: Panama Canal. Fact: The Panama Canal  is an artificial waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade. Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 m (85 ft) above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 32.5 m (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, neo-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.

5. Title: St. Peters Canal. Fact: The St. Peters Canal is a small shipping canal located in eastern Canada on Cape Breton Island. It crosses an isthmus in the village of St. Peter's, Nova Scotia which connects St. Peters Inlet of Bras d'Or Lake to the north with St. Peters Bay of the Atlantic Ocean to the south.

The album's diverse sounds include tape loops and backwards recordings on the psychedelic "Tomorrow Never Knows", a classical string octet on "Eleanor Rigby", and Indian-music backing on "Love You To".

It is the best known and most successful musical collaboration ever by records sold, with the Beatles selling over 600 million records worldwide as of 2004. Between 5 October 1962 and 8 May 1970, the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs, of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles, forming the bulk of their catalogue.

3. Title: Love Songs to the Beatles. Fact: All tracks composed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney

Question: Communist and labor activist James Henry Miller wrote and performed "The Manchester Rambler" under what stage name?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Manchester Rambler. Fact: "The Manchester Rambler", also known as "I'm a Rambler" and "The Rambler's Song", is a song written by the English folk singer Ewan MacColl. It was inspired by his participation in the Kinder trespass, a protest by the urban Young Communist League of Manchester, and was the work that began MacColl's career as a singer-songwriter.

2. Title: Ewan MacColl. Fact: James Henry Miller (25 January 1915 – 22 October 1989), better known by his stage name Ewan MacColl, was an English folk singer, songwriter, communist, labour activist, actor, poet, playwright and record producer.

3. Title: George Washington Dixon. Fact: George Washington Dixon (1801? – March 2, 1861) was an American singer, stage actor, and newspaper editor. He rose to prominence as a blackface performer (possibly the first American to do so) after performing "Coal Black Rose", "Zip Coon", and similar songs. He later turned to a career in journalism, during which he earned the enmity of members of the upper class for his frequent allegations against them.

4. Title: J. William Lloyd. Fact: J. William Lloyd (never using his given name John) (June 4, 1857 – October 23, 1940) was an American individualist anarchist from 1884 to around 1904. He was born in Westfield, New Jersey; he later moved to Kansas, then Iowa, then to experimental colonies in Tennessee and Florida, before returning to New Jersey in 1888. He based his anarchism upon natural law, rather than on egoism as Benjamin Tucker did. His first book, "Wind-Harp Songs" (poetry), was published in 1895 ("Anarchists' March," a printed musical score with words by Lloyd, had been issued by Tucker in 1888). He founded an anarchist group, The Comradeship of Free Socialists, in 1897. His work, "The Red Heart in a White World: A Suggestive Manual of Free Society; Containing a Method and a Hope," formed the basis for it. Lloyd later modified his position to minarchism.

5. Title: Bobby Jameson. Fact: Robert Parker Jameson (April 20, 1945 – May 12, 2015) was an American singer-songwriter who was briefly promoted as a major star in the early 1960s and later attracted a cult following with his 1965 album "Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest", issued under the name Chris Lucey. The album's dark lyrics and sophisticated arrangements led its advocates to note similarities with Love's 1967 album "Forever Changes". For decades, little was known about Jameson or his origins, and he was more famous for engaging in public disturbances and suicide attempts than his music.

1. Title: Supreme Court of Indiana. Fact: The Indiana Supreme Court was established in 1816 when Indiana was granted statehood. The new Court replaced the General Court of the Indiana Territory, which consisted of a three-member panel. Housed in a three-room building it shared with the Indiana legislature, the Court held its first session in Corydon on May 5, 1817. Under the state constitution of 1816, the governor appointed justices with the state senate's "advice and consent" for a term of seven years.

2. Title: List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Indiana. Fact: The following are lists of members of the Supreme Court of Indiana. Founded in 1816 with the ratification of the Constitution of Indiana, the Court's size has varied between three and five members serving at the same time.

3. Title: Indiana State Bar Association. Fact: The ISBA began on 23 June 1896 in the hall of the Indiana House of Representatives with more than 100 lawyers present. Benjamin Harrison served as the Association's first president and remains the only two-term president in its history. Three years earlier he had concluded his service as the nation's 23rd president and returned to his law practice in Indiana.

4. Title: Constitution of Indiana. Fact: The Constitution of Indiana is the highest body of state law in the U.S. state of Indiana. It establishes the structure and function of the state and is based on the principles of federalism and Jacksonian democracy. Indiana's constitution is subordinate only to the U.S. Constitution and federal law. Prior to the enactment of Indiana's first state constitution and achievement of statehood in 1816, the Indiana Territory was governed by territorial law. The state's first constitution was created in 1816, after the U.S. Congress had agreed to grant statehood to the former Indiana Territory. The present-day document, which went into effect on November 1, 1851, is the state's second constitution. It supersedes Indiana's 1816 constitution and has had numerous amendments since its initial adoption.

5. Title: Warren County Courthouse (Indiana). Fact: At the first Warren County seat of Warrenton, a log house owned (and occupied) by Enoch Farmer was used for general court and county purposes. When the county seat was moved to Williamsport, a log house belonging to the town's proprietor, William Harrison, served as the courthouse starting in July 1829. In 1832, plans were made for a new building, and in July of that year the construction bid was won by E. W. Jones and Seth Flowers. The new building was to be made of brick, square and high, and was to be completed by August 1833; but various problems delayed this until mid-1834. The cost of construction was about $2000. In 1835 the building was strengthened and improved.

Question: who owns the means of production in capitalism
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Means of production. Fact: Ownership of the means of production and control over the surplus product generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different modes of production. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of unearned income for its owners. By contrast, socialism is defined as social ownership of the means of production so that the surplus product accrues to society at large.

2. Title: Collective ownership. Fact: Collective ownership of the means of production is the defining characteristic of socialism, where "collective ownership" can refer to society-wide ownership or to cooperative ownership by an organization's members. It more commonly refers to group ownership (such as a producer cooperative) as contrasted with public ownership.

3. Title: Finance capitalism. Fact: Finance capitalism or financial capitalism is the subordination of processes of production to the accumulation of money profits in a financial system.

4. Title: Rentier capitalism. Fact: Rentier capitalism is a term currently used to describe the belief in economic practices of monopolization of access to any (physical, financial, intellectual, etc.) kind of property, and gaining significant amounts of profit without contribution to society. The origins of the term are unclear; it is often said to be used in Marxism, yet the very combination of words rentier and capitalism was never used by Karl Marx himself.

5. Title: Social ownership. Fact: The two major forms of social ownership are society-wide public ownership and cooperative ownership. The distinction between these two forms lies in the distribution of the surplus product. With society-wide public ownership, the surplus is distributed to all members of the public through a social dividend, whereas with co-operative ownership the economic surplus of an enterprise is controlled by all the worker-members of that specific enterprise.

Question: The Balfour Building is located at the Northeast corner of Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, it was named after Arthur J. Balfour, author of which public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Balfour Declaration. Fact: The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a  "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population. It read:

2. Title: Balfour Building. Fact: The Balfour Building is located at the Northeast corner of Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, close to the Financial and Entertainment districts, Gardiner Expressway, and the LRT. It was named after Arthur J. Balfour, author of the "Balfour Declaration" in 1917, whose goal was for the British government to support a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The high-rise was built originally for the Schiffer-Hillman Clothing Company; it was managed by numerous Jewish clothing companies in its early years. Presently, the Balfour Building is a historical tower landmark of Art Deco style in the 1930s. Elevators were installed by Otis-Fensom of Hamilton. The building has hardwood flooring, a rooftop terrace and various recently added features, including forced air heating and centrally controlled air conditioning.

3. Title: Balfour Declaration of 1926. Fact: The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial premiers on 15 November 1926. It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

4. Title: Charles Dreyfus. Fact: Charles Dreyfus (b. Alsace, 1848 - d. Menton, France, 11 December 1935) was President of the Manchester Zionist Society, a member of Manchester City Council and a leading figure in the East Manchester Conservative Association during the time that Arthur Balfour was Member of Parliament for the constituency and Prime Minister. At Dreyfus' suggestion Balfour and future Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann first met at a constituency meeting on 27 January 1905. Dreyfus had been introduced to Weizmann by the Zionist activist and writer Joseph Massel.

5. Title: MacDonald Letter. Fact: The MacDonald Letter of 13 February 1931, also known as the Black Letter, was a letter from British prime minister Ramsay MacDonald to Chaim Weizmann, prominent Zionist leader, in response to the Passfield White Paper. The White Paper limited Jewish immigration to Palestine and Jewish purchase of Arab land. Zionist organizations worldwide mounted a vigorous campaign against the document, which culminated in MacDonald's "clarification" of the White Paper, reaffirming British support for the continuation of Jewish immigration and land purchase in Palestine. It was considered a withdrawal of the Passfield White Paper, despite the fact that Prime Minister said in parliament on 11 February 1931 that he was "very unwilling to give the letter the same status as the dominating document" i.e. the Passfield White Paper. The letter itself also claimed the importance of justice for "non-Jewish sections of the community".

Question: when do the raiders become the las vegas raiders
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. Fact: The Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas was a successful effort by the owner of the Oakland Raiders (Mark Davis) to relocate the American football club from its current and longtime home of Oakland, California to Paradise, Nevada. The team is scheduled to begin play as the Las Vegas Raiders for the 2020 National Football League (NFL) season, playing home games at the Las Vegas Stadium, although a move to Las Vegas could happen as soon as 2019 with Sam Boyd Stadium. NFL team owners voted 31–1 to approve the move, which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix, Arizona on March 27, 2017. The Raiders became the third NFL franchise to relocate in the 2010s, following the Rams' move from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles, California on January 12, 2016, and the Chargers' move from San Diego, California to Los Angeles on January 12, 2017. The Raiders' move to Las Vegas comes after years of failed efforts to renovate or replace the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, which has been rated by multiple sources as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL.

2. Title: 2017 Oakland Raiders season. Fact: The Raiders began the season on September 10 at the Tennessee Titans and finished the season December 31 at the Los Angeles Chargers. The Raiders, as they did in 2016, played one home game in Mexico City, this time against the New England Patriots. Although the league approved the Raiders' eventual relocation to Las Vegas on March 27, 2017, the team still maintained its lease at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and intended to use the stadium for at least the 2017 and 2018 seasons and the 2019 season.

3. Title: Oakland Raiderettes. Fact: The team plans to bring the cheerleading squad when they relocate to Las Vegas in 2020.

4. Title: Las Vegas Thunderbirds. Fact: The Las Vegas Thunderbirds were announced by the WSHL as an expansion team on February 14, 2019. They will begin play in the 2019–20 season.

5. Title: Las Vegas Legends. Fact: On September 5, 2019, it was announced that the club would return to competitive play in 2020 as a member of the National Premier Soccer League.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2004–05 ACF Fiorentina season. Fact: ACF Fiorentina returned to Serie A, following a two-year absence after the bankruptcy of the previous incarnation of the club. Fiorentina returned only due to the expansion in terms of the number of top-league teams, and therefore had to significantly strengthen the squad in pre-season. Dario Dainelli, Giorgio Chiellini, Hidetoshi Nakata, Fabrizio Miccoli, Martin Jørgensen, goalkeeper Cristiano Lupatelli, Enzo Maresca, Tomáš Ujfaluši and Javier Portillo were among the highly rated players to sign up for Fiorentina, either permanently or on loan. With this squad, Fiorentina was expected to challenge for a place on the top half of the table, but slipped into the relegation battle that affected more than half of the Serie A clubs during the dramatic season. In the end, a strong finish to the season under incoming coach Dino Zoff saved La Viola from relegation, with an emotional 3–0 victory against Brescia confirming their survival.

2. Title: Javier Portillo. Fact: Javier García Portillo (born 30 March 1982 in Aranjuez, Community of Madrid) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a forward.

3. Title: Alexandro Cavagnera. Fact: He signed with Milan in July 2018, although he spent the season on loan at Swiss club Lugano. He was released by Milan in September 2019.

4. Title: 2018–19 Juventus F.C. season. Fact: On 10 July 2018, Cristiano Ronaldo became the highest ever transfer for an Italian club with his €100 million transfer from Real Madrid.

5. Title: 2006–07 Juventus F.C. season. Fact: Following the enforced relegation, Juventus lost Fabio Cannavaro and Emerson to Real Madrid, Lilian Thuram and Gianluca Zambrotta to Barcelona, Adrian Mutu to Fiorentina, and Patrick Vieira and Zlatan Ibrahimović to Internazionale. The remainder of the squad did however stay including Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini, Pavel Nedvěd, David Trezeguet, Marcelo Zalayeta and Mauro Camoranesi, for the following 2006–07 Serie B season.

Question: what group was not part of the new deal coalition
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: New Deal coalition. Fact: The 1932 presidential election and the 1934 Senate and House of Representatives elections brought about long-term shifts in voting behavior, and became an enduring realignment. Roosevelt set up his New Deal in 1933 and forged a coalition of labor unions, liberals, religious, ethnic and racial minorities (Catholics, Jews and Blacks), Southern whites, poor people and those on relief. The organizational heft was provided by big-city machines, which gained access to millions of relief jobs and billions of dollars in spending projects. These voting blocs together formed a majority of voters and handed the Democratic Party seven victories out of nine presidential elections (1932–1948, 1960, 1964), as well as control of both houses of Congress during all but four years between the years 1932–1980 (Republicans won small majorities in 1946 and 1952). Starting in the 1930s, the term "liberal" was used in US politics to indicate supporters of the coalition, "conservative" its opponents. The coalition was never formally organized, and the constituent members often disagreed. The coalition usually was often divided on foreign policy and racial issues but was more united to support liberal proposals in other domestic policy.

2. Title: New Alliance Party. Fact: The New Alliance Party (NAP) was an American political party formed in New York City in 1979. Its immediate precursor was an umbrella organization known as the Labor Community Alliance for Change, whose member groups included the Coalition of Grass Roots Women and the New York City Unemployed and Welfare Council. These groups were all associated with controversial psychologist and political activist Fred Newman, whose radical healthcare collectives, Centers for Change and Marxist International Workers Party, were active in grassroots politics in New York City.

3. Title: Union Party (United States). Fact: The Union Party was a short-lived political party in the United States, formed in 1936 by a coalition of radio priest Father Charles Coughlin, old-age pension advocate Francis Townsend, and Gerald L. K. Smith, who had taken control of Huey Long's Share Our Wealth (SOW) movement after Long's assassination in 1935. Each of those people hoped to channel their wide followings into support for the Union Party, which proposed a populist alternative to the New Deal reforms of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.

4. Title: New World Alliance. Fact: The New World Alliance was an American political organization that sought to articulate and implement what it called "transformational" political ideas. It was organized in the late 1970s and dissolved in 1983. It has been described as the first U.S. national political organization of its type and as the first entity to articulate a comprehensive transformational political program.

5. Title: National Union for Social Justice (organization). Fact: The National Union for Social Justice was a United States political movement formed in 1934 by Charles Coughlin, a Catholic priest and radio host. It heavily criticized communism, capitalism, and the presidential administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, while also advocating for the nationalization of utilities and banks.

Question: The proposed autonomous region within the Philippines, originating from an independence movement to seperate the Muslim majority-Moro areas, is now called what?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Fact: The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (; "Al-ḥukm adh-dhātiyy al-'aqlīmiyy limuslimiyy mindanāu"; abbreviated as ARMM) was an autonomous region of the Philippines, located in the Mindanao island group of the Philippines, that consisted of five predominantly Muslim provinces: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. It was the only region that had its own government. The region's "de facto" seat of government was Cotabato City, although this self-governing city was outside its jurisdiction.

2. Title: Cordillera autonomy movement. Fact: The 1986 Constitution allows for the establishment of two autonomous regions in the country; Muslim Mindanao and in the Cordilleras. Two plebiscites (1990 and 1998) were conducted in the Cordillera to legalize the autonomous status of the area where majority of the voters rejected autonomy. The area is currently under the jurisdiction of the Cordillera Administrative Region.

3. Title: Autonomous regions of the Philippines. Fact: An autonomous region of the Philippines  is a first-level administrative division and it has the authority to control the region's culture and economy. It is a minority entity that has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group. The Constitution of the Philippines allows for two autonomous regions: for Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao.

4. Title: Moro National Liberation Front. Fact: In 1996, the MNLF signed a landmark peace agreement with the Philippine government that saw the creation of Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), an area composed of two mainland provinces and three island provinces in which the predominantly Muslim population enjoys a degree of self-rule. Nur Misuari was installed as the region's governor but his rule ended in violence when he led a failed rebellion against the Philippine government in November 2001, and fled to Sabah before being deported back to the Philippines by the Malaysian authorities.

5. Title: Autonomous regions of the Philippines. Fact: On October 15, 2012, a preliminary agreement was signed by the Government of the Philippines' chief negotiator Marvic Leonen, MILF Peace Panel Chair Mohagher Iqbal and Malaysian facilitator Tengku Dato’ Ab Ghafar Tengku Mohamed along with President Aquino, Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia, MILF chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim and Secretary-General Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation at Malacañang Palace in Manila.

Question: who is the injured man in the open boat
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Open Boat. Fact: "The Open Boat" is divided into seven sections, each told mainly from the point of view of the correspondent, based upon Crane himself. The first part introduces the four characters—the correspondent, a condescending observer detached from the rest of the group; the captain, who is injured and morose at having lost his ship, yet capable of leadership; the cook, fat and comical, but optimistic that they will be rescued; and the oiler, Billie, who is physically the strongest, and the only one in the story referred to by name. The four are survivors of a shipwreck, which occurred before the beginning of the story, and are drifting at sea in a small dinghy.

2. Title: Kirby Logan Archer. Fact: Kirby Logan Archer is an American citizen who was found adrift on September 24, 2007 in a lifeboat under circumstances that triggered suspicion. He later pleaded guilty to hijacking the fishing charter vessel the "Joe Cool" and participating in the murders of the vessel's crew.

3. Title: Shane O'Mara. Fact: Shane Francis Seamus O'Mara (born December 18, 1982 in Buffalo, New York) is an American rower. He was educated at The Gunnery (a prep school), Northeastern University and Hughes Hall, Cambridge. As a member of Cambridge University Boat Club, he was selected to stroke the 2008 Blue Boat, but fell ill three days before The Boat Race and had to be replaced.

4. Title: An Open Swimmer. Fact: Set in three distinct parts, "An Open Swimmer" is a 'coming of age' novel; it details the late-teen life of a young man named Jerra Nilsam. A considerable part of the novel describes the camping trip taken by Jerra and his childhood friend, Sean. On this camping trip, Jerra and Sean meet an old man living in a shack on the beach near their camp site. As the story progresses, it becomes apparent that the old man had murdered his wife in a similar shack on a nearby beach by burning it down with her inside. Many sub-plots are scattered throughout this book in the form of spontaneous paragraphs and dialogues between unnamed characters (but presumably one of them is Jerra).

5. Title: SS Benjamin Noble. Fact: Had she been able to make anchor in the sheltered port of Duluth, the "Benjamin Noble" would have been saved. However, at a key moment in the storm, entry to the harbor was unnavigable after the obsolescent south pier torch light blew out. Harbor laborer Stan Standen tried to reach the light to relight it, but was blown into the canal and lost. Of the estimated 16 to 18

Question: when can the coast guard be transferred to the navy
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: United States Coast Guard. Fact: The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II.

2. Title: History of the United States Coast Guard. Fact: The history of the United States Coast Guard goes back to the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the Department of the Treasury. The Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service were merged to become the Coast Guard per which states: "The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times." In 1939, the United States Lighthouse Service was merged into the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard itself was moved to the Department of Transportation in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the Department of Homeland Security. However, under as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when Congress so directs in the declaration, or when the President directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Department of the Navy.

3. Title: United States Coast Guard Ceremonial Honor Guard. Fact: The U.S. Coast Guard Ceremonial Honor Guard was activated on March 5, 1962 to support Coast Guard ceremonial missions and provide a Coast Guard presence during state occasions, such as the presidential inaugural parade and state and official arrival ceremonies. Prior to this, ad hoc units raised from the Coast Guard Recruit Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey performed these functions. Initially stationed in Baltimore, Maryland, the Coast Guard Ceremonial Honor Guard was redeployed to its current station at the Coast Guard Radio Station in Alexandria, Virginia in 1965.

4. Title: United States Coast Guard Reserve. Fact: The mission of the Coast Guard Reserve is stated in the Reserve Policy Statement issued in 2018:

5. Title: History of the United States Coast Guard. Fact: The modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service, but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton lobbied Congress to authorize a small fleet of vessels to enforce tariffs (an important source of revenue for the new nation). On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 100 revenue officers. From 1790, when the Continental Navy was disbanded, to 1798, when the United States Navy was created, these "revenue cutters" were the country's only naval force.

Question: does north carolina get cold in the winter
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Climate of North Carolina. Fact: North Carolina's climate varies from the Atlantic coast in the east to the Appalachian Mountain range in the west. The mountains often act as a "shield", blocking low temperatures and storms from the Midwest from entering the Piedmont of North Carolina. Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), except in the higher elevations of the Appalachians which have a subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cfb). For most areas in the state, the temperatures in July during the daytime are approximately 90 °F (32 °C). In January the average temperatures range near 50 °F (10 °C). (However, a polar vortex or "cold blast" can significantly bring down average temperatures, seen in the winters of 2014 and 2015.)

2. Title: List of North Carolina weather records. Fact: The following is a list of North Carolina weather records. North Carolina is located on the Atlantic Coast in the Southern United States. Since it has the Appalachian Mountains on the western part of the state, and the ocean on the east, North Carolina has experienced many different weather conditions.

3. Title: Climate change in North Carolina. Fact: Around the year 2080, "temperatures are likely to rise above 95°F approximately 20 to 40 days per year in most of the state, compared with about 10 days per year" in 2016.

4. Title: Climate change in North Carolina. Fact: Climate change in North Carolina is of concern due to its impacts on the environment, climate, people, and economy of North Carolina. "Most of the state has warmed one-half to one degree (F) in the last century, and the sea is rising about one inch every decade." North Carolina, along with the rest of the Southeastern United States, has warmed less than the rest of the country.

5. Title: List of North Carolina hurricanes (2000–present). Fact: North Carolina is a U.S. state located on the Atlantic Seaboard in the southeastern United States. Tropical cyclones—storms characterized by a large low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain—regularly affect the state. According to statistical hurricane research between 1886 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5% of all North Atlantic tropical cyclones have affected the state.

Question: Debbie Van Kiekebelt won a gold in the pentathlon in what July 30 to August 13, 1971 sporting event?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Debbie Van Kiekebelt. Fact: Deborah "Debbie" Van Kiekebelt (born March 1, 1954 in Kitchener, Ontario) is a Canadian athlete and sports broadcaster. She was a gold medallist in the pentathlon at the 1971 Pan American Games, and was named that year's Canadian Woman Athlete of the year. Later, she became Canada's first female sports broadcaster.

2. Title: Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Women's pentathlon. Fact: The women's pentathlon combined event at the 1972 Olympic Games took place on September 2 & 3. The favorites going into the Olympics were Heide Rosendahl and Burglinde Pollak. With Rosendahl narrowly defeating Pollack, by 24 points at the 1971 European Athletics Championships. The second event saw Mary Peters release a tremendous throw in the shot put catapulting her into lead, which she never relinquished.

3. Title: Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Women's 100 metres. Fact: The race was won by defending champion Wyomia Tyus. She became the first person to defend the championship at 100 metres, a feat later duplicated by Carl Lewis, Gail Devers, Shelly-Ann Fraser and Usain Bolt. Director Bud Greenspan filmed Tyus casually dancing behind her starting blocks before the Olympic final. When interviewed later she said she was doing the "Tighten Up" to stay loose. American commentator Dwight Stones suggests this intimidated her opponents.

4. Title: 1971 Pan American Games. Fact: The 6th Pan American Games were held in Cali, Colombia, from July 30 to August 13, 1971. (One source dates the Games from July 25 to August 8.) A total of 2,935 athletes from 32 countries participated in seventeen sports. (One source says 4,000 athletes)

5. Title: 1972 United States Olympic Trials (track and field). Fact: The women's trials were held separately over two days (July 7–8) in Frederick, Maryland, under less elegant conditions at Governor Thomas Johnson High School. There were no wind readings taken during the events that normally require them; while photo-finish equipment was available in Eugene to separate close finishes, it was not available when needed in Frederick. As a consequence, the women's 100 meter race had to declare a tie for second place and was only able to assess one hand time for the winner. Willye White, who qualified for her fifth Olympics at this meet, later complained that "We did poorly at the Olympics because of poor conditions; lack of meets, lack of qualified coaches, and lack of fairness. For example, the nationals and Olympic Trials were conducted on tracks that were not superior, and the team was not in Munich early enough to adjust to the climate and time changes."

Question: Who was the husband of the the English novelist whose work provided the basis for a series of films which includes Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. Fact: Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is a 1943 American horror film produced by Universal Studios starring Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Wolf Man and Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's monster. This was the first of a series of "ensemble" monster films combining characters from several film series. This film, therefore, is both the fifth in the series of films based upon Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, directly after The Ghost of Frankenstein, and a sequel to The Wolf Man.

2. Title: Mary Shelley. Fact: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (née Godwin; 30 August 1797 – 1 February 1851) was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel writer, best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.

3. Title: Father of Frankenstein. Fact: Father of Frankenstein is a 1995 novel by Christopher Bram which speculates on the last days of the life of film director James Whale. Whale directed such groundbreaking works as the 1931 "Frankenstein" and 1933's "The Invisible Man" and was a pioneer in the horror film genre.

4. Title: Guy Endore. Fact: Samuel Guy Endore (July 4, 1901 – February 12, 1970), born Samuel Goldstein and also known as Harry Relis, was an American novelist and screenwriter. During his career he produced a wide array of novels, screenplays, and pamphlets, both published and unpublished. A cult favorite of fans of horror, he is best known for his novel "The Werewolf of Paris", which occupies a significant position in werewolf literature, much in the same way that "Dracula" does for vampire literature. Endore is also known for his left-wing novel of the Haitian Revolution, "Babouk: The Story of A Slave". He was nominated for a screenwriting Oscar for "The Story of G.I. Joe" (1945), and his novel "Methinks the Lady . . ." (1946) was the basis for Ben Hecht's screenplay for "Whirlpool" (1949).

5. Title: Thomas Mann. Fact: Paul Thomas Mann ( , ; ; 6 June 1875 – 12 August 1955) was a German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate. His highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual. His analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized versions of German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer.

Question: is it true that paid search marketing is completely driven by google
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Google Ads. Fact: Google Ads has evolved into Google's main source of revenue, contributing to Google's total advertising revenues of US$95.4 billion in 2017. Google Ads offers services under a pay-per-click (PPC) pricing model. Although an advanced bidding strategy can be used to automatically reach a predefined cost-per-acquisition (CPA), this should not be confused with a true CPA pricing model.

2. Title: Search engine marketing. Fact: In 2007, U.S. advertisers spent US $24.6 billion on search engine marketing. In Q2 2015, Google (73.7%) and the Yahoo/Bing (26.3%) partnership accounted for almost 100% of U.S. search engine spend. As of 2006, SEM was growing much faster than traditional advertising and even other channels of online marketing. Managing search campaigns is either done directly with the SEM vendor or through an SEM tool provider. It may also be self-serve or through an advertising agency. As of October 2016, Google leads the global search engine market with a market share of 89.3%. Bing comes second with a market share of 4.36%, Yahoo comes third with a market share of 3.3%, and Chinese search engine Baidu is fourth globally with a share of about 0.68%.

3. Title: Yahoo! Search Marketing. Fact: Yahoo Search Marketing is a keyword-based "Pay per click" or "Sponsored search" Internet advertising service provided by Yahoo.

4. Title: Googlization. Fact: In 2003, John Battelle and Alex Salkever first introduced the term "googlization" to mean the dominance of Google over nearly all forms of informational commerce on the web. Initially specializing in text-based Internet searching, Google has expanded its services to include image searching, web-based email, online mapping, video sharing, news delivery, instant messaging, mobile phones, and services aimed at the academic community. Google has entered partnerships with established media interests such as Time Warner AOL, News Corporation, "The New York Times", and various news agencies such as Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, and the UK Press Association. Google has therefore become a giant with complex entanglements with traditional and new media.

5. Title: Paid inclusion. Fact: Paid inclusion is a search engine marketing product where the search engine company charges fees related to inclusion of websites in their search index. The use of paid inclusion is controversial and paid inclusion's popularity has decreased over time among search engines.

Question: when did cleveland last won the world series
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Cleveland Indians. Fact: The Cleveland Indians are an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Indians compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. Since 1994, they have played at Progressive Field and are the defending American League champions. The team's spring training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona. Since their establishment as a major league franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two World Series championships: in 1920 and 1948, along with eight Central Division titles and six American League pennants. The Indians' current World Series championship drought is the longest active drought, and through 2016 is the fifth-longest in baseball history.

2. Title: 1995 World Series. Fact: The 1995 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1995 season. The 91st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians. The Braves won in six games to capture their third World Series championship in franchise history (along with 1914 in Boston and 1957 in Milwaukee), making them the first team to win at least one crown in three different cities. This was also Cleveland's first Series appearance in 41 years and marked the resumption of the Fall Classic after the previous year's Series was canceled due to a players' strike.

3. Title: 2016 Cleveland Indians season. Fact: The 2016 Cleveland Indians season was the 116th season for the franchise and the 23rd season at Progressive Field. The Indians won the American League Central Division for the first time since 2007 and also beat the Boston Red Sox in the Division Series for their first playoff win in nine years. They defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the American League Championship Series before losing to the Chicago Cubs in seven games in the 2016 World Series. This was their first appearance in the World Series since 1997.

4. Title: History of the Cleveland Indians. Fact: The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. They are in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League. Since 1994, they have played in Progressive Field. The Cleveland team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) was officially a minor league. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in 1901.

5. Title: Cleveland sports curse. Fact: The Cleveland sports curse was a sports superstition involving the city of Cleveland, Ohio, and its major league professional sports teams, centered on the failure to win a championship in any major league sport for a period of 52 years, from 1964 to 2016. Three major league teams based in Cleveland contributed to belief in the curse: the Browns of the National Football League (NFL); the Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA); and the Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). Combined with the short-lived Barons franchise of the National Hockey League (NHL), Cleveland teams endured an unprecedented 147-season championship drought, having not won a title since the Browns defeated the Baltimore Colts in the 1964 NFL Championship Game two seasons prior to the first Super Bowl.

Question: What was the nationality of the person who wrote the text of "On the Death of the Righteous"?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: On the Death of the Righteous. Fact: On the Death of the Righteous is a composition for choir and orchestra set to the text of John Donne by the American composer Jennifer Higdon.  The work was commissioned by the Mendelssohn Club in 2009 to celebrate Alan Harler's 20th season as their music director.  The piece was first performed on March 29, 2009 by the Mendelssohn Club orchestra and choir under the conductor Alan Harler.

2. Title: François Bonivard. Fact: François Bonivard (or Bonnivard; 1493–1570) was a nobleman, ecclesiastic, historian, and Geneva patriot at the time of the Republic of Geneva. His life was the inspiration for Lord Byron's 1816 poem "The Prisoner of Chillon". He was a partisan of the Protestant Reformation, and by most accounts was a libertine, despite his vocation.

3. Title: Henry Suso. Fact: Henry Suso (also called Amandus, a name adopted in his writings, and Heinrich Seuse in German), was a German Dominican friar and the most popular vernacular writer of the fourteenth century (when considering the number of surviving manuscripts).

His early attacks upon the Inquisition, the city council and other authorities in Toulouse, together with his later publications in Lyon treating of theological subjects, roused the French Inquisition to monitor his activities closely. After being imprisoned several times, he was eventually convicted of heresy, strangled and burned with his books due to the combined efforts of the parlement of Paris, the Inquisition, and the theological faculty of the Sorbonne.

5. Title: Ezechiele Ramin.

Question: what battle occurred in response to texas declaring its independence
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of Texas Revolution battles. Fact: Many Texans believed the war was now over, and the majority of the settlers returned to their homes. The remaining troops were garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in Bexar and at Presidio La Bahia in Goliad. In early January, a large number of the remaining soldiers, most of them adventurers recently arrived from the United States, began clamoring to invade Mexico. Colonel Frank W. Johnson and Dr. James Grant began preparing to attack Matamoros. Even before Cos's defeat, Santa Anna had been making plans to retake Texas. In January, he led the "Army of Operations in Texas" towards the rebellious territory. At the Rio Grande, the army divided; Santa Anna led the bulk of the troops toward Bexar, where he laid siege to the Alamo. The remaining troops, under General Jose de Urrea, traveled up the coastline, easily defeating Johnson and Grant at the battles of San Patricio and Agua Dulce.

2. Title: List of Texas Revolution battles. Fact: When General Santa Anna changed the constitution and began operating as a dictator, Federalists throughout the country revolted; in Texas, an armed uprising began on October 2, 1835, when settlers refused to return a small cannon to Mexican troops. This Battle of Gonzales ended with Mexican troops retreating empty-handed to San Antonio de Bexar (now the U.S. city of San Antonio, Texas). Emboldened by their victory, the Texans formed a volunteer army. A small force of Texans traveled down the Texas coastline, defeating Mexican troops at Goliad and at Fort Lipantitlán. The majority of the Texan troops followed General Sam Houston where they initiated a siege of the Mexican garrison. After victories in several skirmishes, including the Battle of Concepción and the Grass Fight, the Texans attacked Bexar. After several days of fighting, the Siege of Bexar ended with the surrender of the Mexican general.

3. Title: Texas Revolution. Fact: Determined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas. His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General José de Urrea led a contingent of troops on the Goliad Campaign up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to San Antonio de Béxar (or Béxar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the Battle of the Alamo, killing almost all of the defenders.

4. Title: Texas Declaration of Independence. Fact: In October 1835, settlers in Mexican Texas launched the Texas Revolution.

5. Title: Texas Campaign. Fact: The Texas Campaign was the first front in the Mexican–American War, fought between the United States and Mexico. The front started with a Mexican assault near Brownsville. US forces were forced to surrender after hours of resisting, which lead President James K. Polk to declare war on Mexico. After the United States defeated a larger Mexican Army at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, Mexican Forces led by Mariano Arista retreated out of Texas.

The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as "The Traveler" would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark.

Question: how many ivy league schools are there in the united states
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Ivy League. Fact: The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.

2. Title: List of Ivy League medical schools. Fact: This list of Ivy League medical schools outlines the seven universities of the Ivy League that host a medical school. Only one Ivy League university, Princeton University, does not have a medical school. All Ivy League medical schools are located in the Northeast region of the United States and are privately owned and controlled. Only two of the schools, at Dartmouth and Penn, are located adjacent to the undergraduate campuses. The schools at Brown, Columbia, Harvard, and Yale, are located on separate campuses in the same metropolitan area as the university. The school at Cornell, Weill Cornell Medicine, is located in New York City, far from the main Ithaca campus.

3. Title: List of research universities in the United States. Fact: There are 131 institutions that are classified as "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as of the 2019 update.

4. Title: List of Ivy League law schools. Fact: This list of Ivy League law schools outlines the five universities of the Ivy League that host a law school. The three Ivy League universities that do not offer law degrees are Princeton, Brown, and Dartmouth. All five Ivy League law schools are consistently ranked among the top 14 law schools in the nation or T14.

5. Title: Ivy Council. Fact: Founded in 1993 as a way to collaborate and exchange ideas on common student life issues at their respective school, student government leaders set the stage for the Ivy Council that exists today. In 1997, in response to the complexities of running a loose federation of organizations over seven states, a defining structure was created. The Ivy Council draws its membership from the Brown University Undergraduate Council of Students, Columbia University (the Columbia College Student Council, the Columbia Engineering Student Council, and the Columbia General Studies Student Council), the Cornell University Student Assembly, the Dartmouth College Student Assembly, the Harvard University Undergraduate Council, the University of Pennsylvania Undergraduate Assembly, the Princeton University Undergraduate Student Government, and the Yale College Council.

Question: In between Daldøs and Masterpiece which one was invented by Joseph M. Burck?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Daldøs. Fact: Daldøs [dal'døs] is a running-fight board game only known from a few coastal locations in Scandinavia, where its history can be traced back to around 1800. The game is notable for its unusual four-sided dice (stick or long dice). In Denmark it is known as daldøs in Northern and Western Jutland (Mors, Thisted and Fanø), and possibly as daldos on Bornholm. In Norway it is known under the name of daldøsa from Jæren, where, unlike in Denmark, a continuous tradition of the daldøs game exists. A rather similar game called sáhkku, using virtually identical dice, is known in a number of variants from the Sea Sami in Northern Norway, Finland and Russia. Otherwise, the closest relatives of this game appear to be the tâb games from Northern Africa and South-western Asia, possibly apart from one unlabelled diagram in a codex from Southern England.

2. Title: Masterpiece (game). Fact: Masterpiece is a board game by Parker Brothers, now a brand of Hasbro.  Players participate in auctions for famous works of art. It was invented by Joseph M. Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates and originally published in 1970 by Parker Brothers, and then published again in 1976 and 1996. The game is now out-of-print.  In this game, players compete with other players to bid on potentially valuable paintings, and negotiate with other players to trade these works of art, build a portfolio, amass money, and win the game. The top value of a painting in the 1970 edition is $1 million, and $10 million in the 1996 edition; however, getting the full value for the painting requires some luck in landing on the right square on the board to sell a painting to the bank.

3. Title: Johann Heinrich Alsted. Fact: Johann Heinrich Alsted (March 1588 – November 9, 1638), "the true parent of all the Encyclopædias",. was a German-born Transylvanian Saxon Calvinist minister and academic, known for his varied interests: in Ramism and Lullism, pedagogy and encyclopedias, theology and millenarianism. His contemporaries noted that an anagram of Alstedius was "sedulitas", meaning "hard work" in Latin.

4. Title: Yvo Gaukes. Fact: Yvo Gaukes (Latin: Yvonis; also Yves, Ivo) (c. 1660–1738) was a prominent physician who practised at Emden and can be counted among the iatromathematicians of his time. In his best-known theoretical publication, "Dissertatio de medicina ad certitudinem mathematicam evehenda" (1712) he developed a medical theory on the grounds of Cartesianism, proposing sizes and shapes for the main components of the Four Humors based on these largely philosophical considerations. Gaukes also popularized "Species Lignorum", a variant of the numerous Guaiacum wood extracts that had been used to treat syphilis since the late 16th century.

5. Title: Maelzel's Chess Player. Fact: "Maelzel's Chess Player" (1836) is an essay by Edgar Allan Poe exposing a fraudulent automaton chess player called The Turk, which had become famous in Europe and the United States and toured widely. The fake automaton was invented by Wolfgang von Kempelen in 1769 and was brought to the U.S. in 1825 by Johann Nepomuk Mälzel after von Kempelen's death.

Question: how does a plane wing create lift which physics concept applies
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Lift (force). Fact: The air flow changes direction as it passes the airfoil and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton's second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then, according to Newton's third law, the air must exert an upward force on the airfoil. The overall result is that a reaction force, the lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.

2. Title: Compression lift. Fact: In aerodynamics, compression lift refers to an aircraft that uses shock waves generated by its own supersonic flight to generate lift. This can lead to dramatic improvements in lift for supersonic/hypersonic aircraft. Clarence Syvertson and Alfred J. Eggers discovered this phenomenon in 1956 as they analyzed abnormalities at the reentry of nuclear warheads.

3. Title: Compression lift. Fact: The basic concept of compression lift is well known; "planing" boats reduce drag by "surfing" on their own bow wave in exactly the same fashion. Using this effect in aircraft is more difficult, however, because the "wake" is not generated until supersonic speeds are reached, and is highly angled. Aircraft have to be carefully shaped to take full advantage of this effect. In addition the angle of the shock waves varies greatly with speed, making it even more difficult to design a craft that gains significant lift over a wide range of speeds.

4. Title: Wing twist. Fact: Wing twist is an aerodynamic feature added to aircraft wings to adjust lift distribution along the wing.

5. Title: Lift (soaring). Fact: Lift is a meteorological phenomenon used as an energy source by soaring aircraft and soaring birds. The most common human application of lift is in sport and recreation. The three air sports that use soaring flight are: gliding, hang gliding and paragliding.

Question: name a city that has hosted winter olympics
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Fact: Seven applicant cities presented bids to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics (formally known as "XXII Olympic Winter Games" and "XI Paralympic Winter Games") to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC Executive Board shortlisted three cities—Sochi, Russia; Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea—with Sochi winning the IOC's July 2007 final vote.

2. Title: 2018 Winter Olympics. Fact: Pyeongchang was elected as the host city in July 2011, at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa. This was the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games, having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, but it was only the first Winter Olympics to be held in the country. It was the first of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, the following two being Tokyo 2020 (summer) and Beijing 2022 (winter). It was the third time that an East Asian country had hosted the Winter Games, after Sapporo (1972) and Nagano (1998), both of these cities in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics to be held in mainland Asia.

3. Title: List of Olympic Games host cities. Fact: In 2022, Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games. Seven cities have hosted the Olympic Games more than once: Athens (1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics), Paris (1900, 1924, and 2024 Summer Olympics), London (1908, 1948, and 2012 Summer Olympics), St. Moritz (1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics), Los Angeles (1932, 1984, and 2028 Summer Olympics), and Innsbruck (1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics). Tokyo will join this list upon hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the summer games of 1964, as well as Beijing upon hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, having previously hosted the summer games of 2008. In addition, Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics.[d] London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics. Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics, followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028. The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games, more than any other country, followed by France with five editions. Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games.

4. Title: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Fact: Three cities applied with bids to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics (also known as "XXIII Olympic Winter Games" and "XII Paralympic Winter Games") in October 2009. The International Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Jacques Rogge, received three bids on October 15, 2009. The cities of Annecy, France, in the French Alps, Munich, Germany (host of the 1972 Summer Olympics), and Pyeongchang, South Korea, a two-time previous bidder, competed for the hosting rights to the event. This was the lowest number of bidding cities since the 1988 Summer Olympics, coincidentally also won by South Korea. The winning bid was announced on July 6, 2011, at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa by IOC President Jacques Rogge at 5.22 pm local time

5. Title: Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Fact: A total of six bids were initially submitted for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn by 1 October 2014, citing either the high costs of hosting the Games or the lack of local support, leaving Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China as the only two remaining candidate cities. Beijing was then elected as the host city at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 31 July 2015.

1. Title: Anna of Cilli. Fact: Anna of Cilli or Anne of Celje (c. 1381 – 21 May 1416) was Queen consort of Poland (1402–1416). She was the second wife of Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), King of Poland and Supreme Duke of Lithuania (reigned 1387–1434). Their marriage was politically motivated to strengthen Jogaila's ties with the Piast dynasty and his claims to the Polish throne. Their marriage was rather distant and during fourteen years Anna bore only one daughter, Hedwig Jagiellon, who died without issue.

2. Title: Hedwig Jagiellon (1408–1431). Fact: Hedwig Jagiellon (Lithuanian: Jadvyga Jogailaitė, Polish: Jadwiga Jagiellonka; 8 April 1408, Kraków – 8 December 1431, Kraków) was a Polish and Lithuanian princess, and a member of the Jagiellon dynasty. For most of her life she, as the only child of Wladyslaw Jagiello, was considered to be heiress of the Polish and Lithuanian thrones. After the birth of Jagiello's sons in 1424 and 1427, Hedwig had some support for her claims to the throne. She died in 1431 amidst rumors that she was poisoned by her stepmother Sophia of Halshany.

3. Title: Anna von Schweidnitz. Fact: Anne was the daughter of Polish Duke Henry II of Świdnica-Jawor from the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty. Her mother was Katherine of Hungary, the daughter of Charles I of Hungary. In his autobiography written in Latin, which covers only his youth prior to getting married to Anna, emperor Charles mentions "civitatem Swidnitz" and "dux Swidnicensis", as depicted in the coat of arms room of his Wenzelschloss castle at Lauf an der Pegnitz near Nuremberg.

4. Title: Anna de' Medici. Fact: Anna was the third child of Grand Duke Francesco and Archduchess Joanna. She had two surviving sisters, Eleanor, Duchess of Mantua, and Marie, Queen of France.

5. Title: Anna d'Este. Fact: Anna d'Este (16 November 1531 – 17 May 1607) was an important princess with considerable influence at the court of France and a central figure in the French Wars of Religion. In her first marriage she was Duchess of Aumale, then of Guise, in her second marriage Duchess of Nemours and Genevois.

Question: who was england manager in last world cup
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: England national football team manager. Fact: On 22 July, Sam Allardyce was appointed England manager on a two-year contract. After only 67 days in the job, a video published by The Daily Telegraph showed Allardyce making insulting statements against former manager Roy Hodgson, and explaining how to circumvent regulations of The FA on third party ownership of players. He subsequently left the role as manager of England later that day. Former England international defender and England under-21 coach Gareth Southgate was given the senior role on a caretaker basis for four matches while the FA considered their options. Two wins, including a 3–0 victory over Scotland, and a draw in qualifying matches for the 2018 World Cup and a 2–2 draw with Spain in a friendly followed under Southgate's temporary management, before he was formally appointed to the position full-time on 30 November 2016 on a four-year deal.

2. Title: Paul Fairclough. Fact: Paul Fairclough (born 31 January 1950) is the current manager of the England C national football team, formerly known as the National Game XI, England non-League team or the England semi-pro team.

3. Title: José Mourinho. Fact: José Mário dos Santos Mourinho Félix, (; born 26 January 1963), is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest managers of all time and he is one of the most decorated managers of all time.

4. Title: Mike Bassett: England Manager. Fact: Embracing the embarrassment of England's football record, the film makes use of fan violence, tabloid assassination of the team, and the often amateur nature of English football. After qualifying for the World Cup on a technicality, Bassett and the team head to Brazil for the tournament.

5. Title: List of managers at the FIFA World Cup. Fact: In total, over 350 individuals have managed or co-managed a team in at least one match in the World Cup. Carlos Alberto Parreira is the manager who has appeared in the most editions of the tournament, six from 1982 to 2010. Parreira also shares with Bora Milutinović the record for most different nations managed in the World Cup, with five. Helmut Schön holds the records for both most matches managed (25) and most matches won (16), all with West Germany in 1966–1978.

Question: Michele Ferrero created a spread that was first introduced in what year?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Michele Ferrero. Fact: Michele Ferrero (Italian pronunciation: [miˈkɛːle ferˈrɛːro]; 26 April 1925 – 14 February 2015) was an Italian entrepreneur.  He owned the chocolate manufacturer Ferrero SpA, Europe's second largest confectionery company (at the time of his death), which he developed from the small bakery and café of his father in Alba, Piedmont.  His first big success was adding vegetable oil to the traditional gianduja paste to make the popular spread, Nutella.

2. Title: Nutella. Fact: Nutella (/nuːˈtɛlə/; Italian pronunciation: [nuː-ˈtɛlla]) is a brand of sweetened hazelnut cocoa spread manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero that was first introduced in 1965, although its first iteration dates to 1963.

3. Title: Benedictine (spread). Fact: Benedictine or benedictine spread is a spread made with cucumbers and cream cheese. Invented near the beginning of the 20th century, it was originally and still is used for making cucumber sandwiches, but in recent years it has been used as a dip or combined with meat in a sandwich. This spread can be obtained pre-made from some Louisville area grocery stores.

4. Title: Ravioli. Fact: The earliest known mention of ravioli appears in the personal letters of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant of Prato in the 14th century. In Venice, the mid-14th-century manuscript "Libro per cuoco" offers ravioli of green herbs blanched and minced, mixed with beaten egg and fresh cheese, simmered in broth and seasoned with "sweet and strong spices". In Rome, ravioli were already well-known when Bartolomeo Scappi served them with boiled chicken to the papal conclave of 1549.

5. Title: Commedia all'italiana. Fact: Commedia all'italiana (i.e. "Comedy in the Italian way"; ) or Italian-style comedy is an Italian film genre. It is widely considered to have started with Mario Monicelli's "I soliti ignoti" ("Big Deal on Madonna Street") in 1958 and derives its name from the title of Pietro Germi's "Divorzio all'italiana" ("Divorce Italian Style", 1961).

Question: How many people are playing the board game on the table?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Tables (board game). Fact: Tables is a general name given to a class of board games similar to backgammon, played on a board with two rows of 12 vertical markings called "points". Players roll dice to determine the movement of pieces. Tables games are among the oldest known board games, and many variants are played throughout the world.

2. Title: Nines (card game). Fact: Nines is a trick-taking game played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Nines is played by three people, and the object is to lower your score from 9 to zero.

3. Title: Thirty-one (card game). Fact: Thirty-one or Trente et un is a gambling card game played by two to seven people, where players attempt to assemble a hand which totals 31. Such a goal has formed the whole or part of various games like Commerce, Cribbage, Trentuno, and Wit and Reason since the 15th century.

4. Title: Twenty Questions. Fact: In the traditional game, one player is chosen to be the "answerer". That person chooses a subject (object) but does not reveal this to the others. All other players are "questioners". They each take turns asking a question which can be answered with a simple "Yes" or "No." In variants of the game, multiple state answers may be included such as the answer "Maybe." The answerer answers each question in turn. Sample questions could be: "Is it bigger than a breadbox?" or "Can I put it in my mouth?" Lying is not allowed in the game. If a questioner guesses the correct answer, that questioner wins and becomes the "answerer" for the next round. If 20 questions are asked without a correct guess, then the answerer has stumped the questioners and gets to be the answerer for another round.

5. Title: Las Vegas (board game). Fact: "Las Vegas" is a game for two to five players. It consists of six small boards representing different casinos (originally depicting real Vegas casinos; later the same casinos with faux renamings; in the US release, simply numbered boards with similar decorative backgrounds), a deck of 54 "bills" (cards) in various denominations of the United States dollar (from $10,000 to $90,000 in $10,000 increments), an additional "First Player" card (denoting who starts each round of play) and five sets of eight dice, each set colored differently (orange, green, blue, black and white). The US release also included a dice pouch for storing the game dice.

Question: the shawshank redemption was it a true story
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Fact: "The story is entirely told by the character Red, in a narrative he claims to have been writing from September 1975 to January 1976, with an additional chapter added in spring 1977."

2. Title: The Shawshank Redemption. Fact: Director Frank Darabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983, on the short film adaptation of The Woman in the Room, after buying the rights from King for $1; a Dollar Deal policy King used to help new directors build a resume by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the right to adapt Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a 96-page short story written by King as part of an attempt to explore new genres. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could make for a feature film, Darabont believed it was "obvious". Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. Darabont expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, a minor character in the short story who originally dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hangs himself. Tommy, who in the story trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, is instead in the screenplay murdered on the orders of warden Norton, who is himself an amalgamation of several warden characters in King's story. At the time, prison-based films were not considered reliable box-office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption.

3. Title: Shawshank tree. Fact: The Shawshank Tree was a white oak located near Malabar Farm State Park in Lucas, Ohio, United States, that was featured in the 1994 motion picture "The Shawshank Redemption". The tree was at least tall and approximately 180 to 200 years old. It played a central role in the film's plot and was one of the most popular tourist sites connected to it. The tree was split by lightning on July 29, 2011, and was eventually knocked down by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016.

4. Title: The Skyjacker's Tale. Fact: The Skyjacker's Tale is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Jamie Kastner and released in 2016. The film centres on Ishmael Muslim Ali (formerly Ishmael LaBeet), who received a disputed conviction of murder in the Fountain Valley massacre of 1972 before hijacking a plane to Cuba in 1984. It mixes interviews, including the first interview given by Ali himself since the incident, with dramatic reenactments of the hijacking.

5. Title: The Narrative of Robert Adams. Fact: First published in 1816, The Narrative of Robert Adams is the story of the adventures of Robert Adams, a twenty-five-year-old American sailor who claimed to be enslaved in North Africa for three years, from 1810 to 1814, after surviving a shipwreck. He was said to have finally been ransomed by the British Consul, where he eventually made his way to London. It was there that, as a random beggar on the streets, he was "discovered" by the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa, where he narrated the full details of his adventure.

Question: what was the poster on the wall in shawshank redemption
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Fact: In 1948, in Maine, Andy Dufresne, a banker, is tried and convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. He is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve a double life sentence. There, he meets Red, a prisoner who smuggles items from the outside world. Andy, who had been an amateur geologist before being imprisoned, asks Red to get him a rock hammer for shaping rocks he collects from the exercise yard into small sculptures. One of the next items he orders from Red, is a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the ensuing years, Andy regularly requests more posters from Red, including pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. When asked, Andy tells Red that he likes to imagine he can step through the pictures and be with the actresses.

2. Title: Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. Fact: The design was created in one day and printed first as a street poster. It was then more widely distributed—both as a digital image and other paraphernalia—during the 2008 election season, initially independent of, but with the approval from, the official Obama campaign. The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led "The Guardian's" Laura Barton to proclaim that the image "acquired the kind of instant recognition of Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster, and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come."

3. Title: Poster Boy (film). Fact: The film opens with Henry Kray being interviewed by a reporter about the events about to unfold on-screen. Henry is the son of a powerful and conservative Senator from North Carolina. Senator Kray has gained a national reputation in part by attacking homosexuality. Unknown to the senator, Henry is gay.

4. Title: Beatlesongs. Fact: The original cover (designed by underground comic - and occasional album cover - artist William Stout) was subject of a public outcry as it featured a caricature of Mark David Chapman, the man who murdered John Lennon less than two years earlier. Chapman is pictured on the far left of the cover holding the end of the banner.

5. Title: Barack Obama &quot;Joker&quot; poster. Fact: The Barack Obama "Joker" poster is a digitally manipulated image of former United States President Barack Obama, designed by Firas Alkhateeb in January 2009, that was adopted by some critics of the Obama administration and described as the most famous anti-Obama image. The image portrays Obama as comic book supervillain Joker, based on the portrayal by Heath Ledger in "The Dark Knight" (2008). Alkhateeb has said the image was not intended to make a political statement. He uploaded the image to the photo-sharing website Flickr, from where it was downloaded by an unknown individual who added the caption "socialism".

The Dylan song, set to piano and military snare-drum, was the first of several recorded by the band, included here, according to the record's liner notes, because Bob had attended a gig and declared them "real groovy". The remaining tracks see the Manfreds on familiar ground, mining the US Rhythm and Blues charts for a Paul Jones vocal vehicle and picking up a funky jazz-blues classic that, like the title track, leaves room for the band's excellent soloing.

Question: most runs scored in mlb game all time
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Run (baseball). Fact: The record for most consecutive games with at least one run scored is 18, shared by the Yankees' Red Rolfe (August 9–August 25, 1939) and the Cleveland Indians' Kenny Lofton (August 15–September 3, 2000). The record for most runs scored by a player in a single game is 7, set by Guy Hecker of the American Association's Louisville Colonels on August 15, 1886. The modern-day record of 6 is shared by fourteen players (eight of whom attained it before 1900). Of the six modern-day players to score 6 runs in a game, the first to perform the feat was Mel Ott of the New York Giants on August 4, 1934 (he repeated the accomplishment ten years later, making him the only player ever to do it twice); the most recent was Shawn Green, then of the Los Angeles Dodgers, on May 23, 2002.

2. Title: List of Major League Baseball single-game runs scored leaders. Fact: In Major League Baseball, players have scored six or more runs in one game 16 times. This record has been achieved by 15 players, the most recent being Joe Randa of the Kansas City Royals on September 9, 2004. Mel Ott is the only player to accomplish the feat twice, doing so nearly a decade apart.

3. Title: List of Major League Baseball single-game runs batted in leaders. Fact: In baseball, a run batted in (RBI) is awarded to a batter for each runner who scores as a result of the batter's action, including a hit, fielder's choice, sacrifice fly, sacrifice bunt, catcher's interference, or a walk or hit by pitch with the bases loaded. A batter is also awarded an RBI for scoring himself upon hitting a home run. Sixteen players have batted in at least 10 runs in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date, the most recent being Mark Reynolds of the Washington Nationals on July 6, 2018. No player has accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever recorded more than 12 RBIs in a game. Wilbert Robinson was the first player to record at least 10 RBIs in a single game, driving in 11 runs for the Baltimore Orioles against the St. Louis Browns on June 10, 1892.

4. Title: List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders. Fact: Barry Bonds holds the Major League Baseball home run record with 762. He passed Hank Aaron, who hit 755, on August 7, 2007. The only other player to have hit 700 or more is Babe Ruth with 714. Alex Rodriguez (696), Willie Mays (660), Albert Pujols (656), Ken Griffey, Jr. (630), Jim Thome (612), and Sammy Sosa (609) are the only other players to have hit 600 or more.

5. Title: 500 home run club. Fact: In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron's ultimate career total, 755, remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Twenty-seven players are members of the 500 home run club. Ted Williams (.344) holds the highest batting average among the club members while Harmon Killebrew (.256) holds the lowest.

Question: is devil's food cake the same as chocolate
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Devil's food cake. Fact: Devil's food cake is a moist, airy, rich chocolate layer cake. It is considered a counterpart to the white or yellow angel food cake. Because of differing recipes and changing ingredient availability over the course of the 20th century, it is difficult to precisely qualify what distinguishes devil's food from the more standard chocolate cake, though it traditionally has more chocolate than a regular chocolate cake, making it darker. The cake is usually paired with a rich chocolate frosting.

2. Title: Clementine cake. Fact: Clementine cake is a cake flavored primarily with clementines. It may be topped with a sweet glaze or sauce, powdered sugar, honey and clementines, or candied clementines. It may originate from an orange cake in Sephardic cuisine. In popular culture, the cake played a minor part in the plot of the 2013 film "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty".

3. Title: Sachertorte. Fact: Sachertorte  is a specific type of chocolate cake, or torte, invented by Austrian Franz Sacher in 1832 for Prince Metternich in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties. December 5 is National Sachertorte Day in the United States.

4. Title: Cake of Light. Fact: Cake of Light is the eucharistic host found within Thelema, the religion founded by author and occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904. It contains honey, oil, and particular bodily fluids, and is usually cooked in the shape of a small, flat wafer. It appears by name in two important Thelemic rituals: the Gnostic Mass and the Mass of the Phoenix. However, Crowley thought it was important for magicians to perform a eucharistic ritual of some kind daily (from "Magick Book 4, Liber ABA", ch. 20):

5. Title: Ptasie mleczko. Fact: Ptasie mleczko  is a soft chocolate-covered candy filled with soft meringue or milk soufflé. It is called ptichye moloko (птичье молоко, ) in Russian, lapte de pasăre  in Romanian, ptashyne moloko (пташине молоко) in Ukrainian, and linnupiim in Estonian. All these names literally mean "bird's milk" or crop milk, a substance somewhat resembling milk, produced by certain birds to feed their young. However, this is not the origin of the name; rather, "bird's milk" is an idiom of ancient Greek origin meaning "an unobtainable delicacy" (compare English: "hen's teeth").

Question: who is the original singer of here comes the sun
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Here Comes the Sun. Fact: "Here Comes the Sun" is a song written by George Harrison that was first released on the Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road. Along with "Something" and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", it is one of Harrison's best-known compositions from the Beatles era. The song was written at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton, where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day, to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation. The lyrics reflect the composer's relief at both the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band's business affairs.

2. Title: Here Comes the Sun (Sweetbox song). Fact: The song samples Johann Sebastian Bach's "Prelude No. 1."

3. Title: Here Comes the Summer. Fact: "Here Comes the Summer" is a song originally written and recorded by Northern Irish band the Undertones. The song was inspired by the Ramones and was written in 1978 by the band's principal songwriter, John O'Neill. It was included, initially as an album track, on their eponymous debut LP, which was released in May 1979.

4. Title: Here Comes the Moon. Fact: "Here Comes the Moon" is a song by English musician George Harrison from his 1979 album "George Harrison". Harrison wrote the song while on holiday on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. His inspiration for the composition was the appearance of the moon in the evening sky, just as the sun was setting. Although the lyrics focus on this natural occurrence rather than on the symbolism it suggests, in the manner of Harrison's Beatles track "Here Comes the Sun", the song is seen as a sequel to that similarly titled piece.

5. Title: Georgia Turner. Fact: Georgia Turner (1921-1969) (born Georgia Bell Turner known after marriage as Georgia Turner Connelly), was an American folk singer. She is credited with an early recording of "Rising Sun Blues", produced by Alan Lomax in 1937, in Middlesboro, Kentucky. Her adaptation of this American folk classic, better known as "House Of The Rising Sun," has become the standard, the ancestor of covers by hundreds of later performers, including Dave Van Ronk, Bob Dylan, The Animals, Joan Baez, Tracy Chapman, Muse, and even Andy Griffith. (The lyrics later published by Lomax in "Our Singing Country" in 1941 incorporate some lines from a version performed by Bert Martin.)

Question: who said love means never having to say you're sorry
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Love means never having to say you're sorry. Fact: "Love means never having to say you're sorry" is a catchphrase based on a line from the Erich Segal novel Love Story and was popularized by its 1970 film adaptation starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. The line is spoken twice in the film: once in the middle of the film, by Jennifer Cavalleri (MacGraw's character), when Oliver Barrett (O'Neal) apologizes to her for his anger; and as the last line of the film, by Oliver, when his father says "I'm sorry" after learning of Jennifer's death. In the script the line is phrased slightly differently: "Love means not ever having to say you're sorry."

2. Title: The love that dare not speak its name. Fact: The love that dare not speak its name is a phrase from the last line of the poem "" by Lord Alfred Douglas, written in September 1892 and published in the Oxford magazine "The Chameleon" in December 1894. It was mentioned at Oscar Wilde's gross indecency trial and is usually interpreted as a euphemism for homosexuality (although Wilde denied that it was).

3. Title: Love Is.... Fact: Love Is... is a comic strip created by New Zealand cartoonist Kim Casali (née Grove) in the 1960s. The cartoons originated from a series of love notes that Grove drew for her future husband, Roberto Casali. They were published in booklets in the late 1960s before appearing in strip form in a newspaper in 1970, under the pen name "Kim". They were syndicated soon after and the strip is syndicated worldwide today by Tribune Content Agency. One of her most famous drawings, ""Love Is...being able to say you are sorry"", published on February 9, 1972, was marketed internationally for many years in print, on cards and on souvenirs. The beginning of the strip coincided closely with the 1970 film "Love Story". The film's signature line is "Love means never having to say you're sorry." At the height of their popularity in the 1970s the cartoons were earning Casali £4-5 million annually.

4. Title: Love Is No Excuse. Fact: "Love Is No Excuse" is a single by American country music artists Jim Reeves and Dottie West. Released in February 1964, the song peaked at number 7 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart and #15 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles listing. The song was also recorded by Ernest Tubb, John Grier, Connie Smith in French and English, Hank King, Jack Greene and Jeannie Seely, and Shot Jackson,

5. Title: Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word. Fact: "Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word" is a song written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. It was recorded by Elton John and released in 1976, both as a single and as part of the "Blue Moves" album. It was John's second single released by The Rocket Record Company. The song is a mournful ballad about a romantic relationship which is falling apart.

Question: King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare, which term designation is given to most tragedies, written by playwright William Shakespeare?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: King Lear. Fact: King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare. It depicts the gradual descent into madness of the title character, after he disposes of his kingdom giving bequests to two of his three daughters based on their flattery of him, bringing tragic consequences for all. Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain, a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king, the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures, with the title role coveted by many of the world's most accomplished actors.

2. Title: Shakespearean tragedy. Fact: Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as "histories" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the "problem play," for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars.

3. Title: William Shakespeare. Fact: William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

4. Title: Outline of William Shakespeare. Fact: The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the life and legacy of William Shakespeare. William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and actor who lived during the 17th century. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".

5. Title: Macbeth. Fact: Macbeth (; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, "Macbeth" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.

Question: where did the sons of liberty hold their meetings
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Liberty Tree. Fact: The tree became a central gathering place for protesters, and the ground surrounding it became popularly known as Liberty Hall. A liberty pole was installed nearby with a flag that could be raised above the tree to summon the townspeople to a meeting. Ebenezer Mackintosh, a shoemaker who handled much of the hands-on work of hanging effigies and leading angry mobs, became known as "Captain General of the Liberty Tree." Paul Revere included the Liberty Tree in an engraving, "A View of the Year 1765."

2. Title: Congress of Alexandria. Fact: The meeting was held on 15 April 1755 at Carlyle House in Alexandria, Virginia, home of one of that city's prominent figures, John Carlyle.

Question: who does creon initially blame for the burial of polyneices
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Antigone (Sophocles play). Fact: Creon enters, along with the Chorus of Theban Elders. He seeks their support in the days to come and in particular, wants them to back his edict regarding the disposal of Polyneices' body. The Leader of the Chorus pledges his support out of deference to Creon. A Sentry enters, fearfully reporting that the body has been given funeral rites and a symbolic burial with a thin covering of earth, though no one saw who had actually committed the crime. Creon, furious, orders the Sentry to find the culprit or face death himself. The Sentry leaves, and the Chorus sings about honouring the gods, but after a short absence, he returns, bringing Antigone with him. The Sentry explains that the watchmen uncovered Polyneices' body and then caught Antigone as she did the funeral rituals. Creon questions her after sending the Sentry away, and she does not deny what she has done. She argues unflinchingly with Creon about the immorality of the edict and the morality of her actions. Creon becomes furious, and, thinking Ismene must have known of Antigone's plan, seeing her upset, summons the girl. Ismene tries to confess falsely to the crime, wishing to die alongside her sister, but Antigone will not have it. Creon orders that the two women be temporarily imprisoned.

2. Title: Antigone (Euripides play). Fact: Sophocles' "Antigone" (ca. 441 BCE) told the story of how Oedipus' daughter Antigone buried the body of her brother Polynices who had led an invasion of Thebes, defying the order of her uncle Creon who was ruling Thebes. As a result, Creon condemned her to death, and although Creon rescinded the death sentence, Antigone and her lover Haemon, Creon's son, killed themselves.

3. Title: Polyxena. Fact: In Greek mythology, Polyxena (; Greek: ) was the youngest daughter of King Priam of Troy and his queen, Hecuba. She does not appear in Homer, but in several other classical authors, though the details of her story vary considerably. After the fall of Troy, she dies when sacrificed by the Greeks on the tomb of Achilles, to whom she had been betrothed and in whose death she was complicit in many versions.

4. Title: Polynices. Fact: In the "Thebaid", the brothers were cursed by their father for their disrespect towards him on two occasions. The first of these occurred when they served him using the silver table of Cadmus and a golden cup, which he had forbidden. The brothers then sent him the haunch of a sacrificed animal, rather than the shoulder, which he deserved. Enraged, Oedipus prayed to Zeus that the brothers would die by each other's hand. However, in Sophocles' "Oedipus at Colonus", Oedipus desired to stay in Thebes but was expelled by Creon. His sons argued over the throne, but Eteocles gained the support of the Thebans and expelled Polynices, who went to Oedipus to ask for his blessing to retake the city, but instead was cursed to die by his brother's hand. His son was Thersander.

5. Title: Eurymedon the Hierophant. Fact: Eurymedon the Hierophant (; ) was a representative of the priestly clan overseeing the Eleusinian Mysteries. Together with Demophilus he reportedly brought a charge of impiety against Aristotle after Alexander the Great's death in 322 BC.

Question: did oscar de la hoya fight julio cesar chavez
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Julio César Chávez II. Fact: De La Hoya and Chavez had previously fought each other over two years earlier on June 7, 1996 for Chavez's WBC super lightweight title. In a highly–anticipated matchup, De La Hoya dominated the aging champion, winning the first three rounds on all three judge's scorecards before the fight was stopped in the fourth round due to a large gash Chavez had received over his eye after a De La Hoya right hand. In spite of De La Hoya's dominating victory, Chavez remained defiant, giving De La Hoya little credit, stating that his punches had not hurt him and solely blaming the loss on his lack of vision due to the gash. Chavez demanded a rematch as a result, but an immediate rematch could not take place as De La Hoya already had a mandatory defense lined up (which would prove to be against Miguel Ángel González in January 1997) before facing Pernell Whitaker in a super fight for Whitaker's welterweight title. De La Hoya would defeat Whitaker to capture the title and then go on to successfully defend it three times before a rematch with Chavez was announced in April 1998. The bout was contingent on both De La Hoya and Chavez winning their tune–up fights against Patrick Charpentier and Ken Sigurani respectively, which both men did, officially putting their rematch on.

2. Title: Julio César Chávez vs. Oscar De La Hoya. Fact: Julio César Chávez vs. Oscar De La Hoya, billed as "Ultimate Glory", was a professional boxing match contested on June 7, 1996 for the WBC and lineal super lightweight championship.

3. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Fernando Vargas. Fact: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Fernando Vargas, billed as "Bad Blood", was a professional boxing match contested on September 14, 2002, for De La Hoya's WBC and lineal super welterweight (light–middleweight) championships, Vargas' WBA super welterweight championship, and the vacant "The Ring" light–middleweight championship.

4. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Héctor Camacho. Fact: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Hector Camacho, billed as "Opposites Attack", was a professional boxing match contested on September 13, 1997 for the WBC and lineal welterweight championships.

5. Title: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr.. Fact: Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr., billed as The World Awaits, was a light middleweight superfight that took place on May 5, 2007, at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada between six-division world champion Oscar De La Hoya (38–4, 30 KO) and undefeated four-division champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (37–0, 24 KO). At the time, the bout was the most lucrative boxing match ever, with over $130 million in generated revenue.

Question: who came up with the idea of gravity
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of gravitational theory. Fact: In the 4th century BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that there is no effect or motion without a cause. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element earth, was related to their nature, which caused them to move downward toward the center of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element fire, move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the sphere of the Moon. Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the earth by an external force of gravity, but tend toward the center of the universe because of an inner gravitas or heaviness.

2. Title: History of general relativity. Fact: General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.

3. Title: Newton's law of universal gravitation. Fact: Newton's law of universal gravitation is usually stated that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" ("the "Principia""), first published on 5 July 1687. When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him.

4. Title: Gravity. Fact: Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915) which describes gravity not as a force, but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's event horizon. However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other, with the force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

5. Title: Newton's cannonball. Fact: Newton's cannonball was a thought experiment Isaac Newton used to hypothesize that the force of gravity was universal, and it was the key force for planetary motion. It appeared in his book "A Treatise of the System of the World".

Question: what car does reynolds woodcock drive in phantom thread
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Phantom Thread. Fact: Filming also took place in 2017 at Owlpen Manor in the Cotswolds and in the London neighborhood of Fitzrovia, in Fitzroy Square, and Grafton Mews. Woodcock drives a maroon Bristol 405 in the film.

2. Title: Rolls-Royce Phantom VI. Fact: Fundamentally an updated Phantom V, the Phantom VI had a restyled dashboard and was powered by an engine derived from the current Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. Most of the coachwork was created by Mulliner Park Ward, usually in limousine form, though a few landaulettes were made.

3. Title: Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé. Fact: The exterior resembles that of the 100EX. The 2-door 4-seat convertible has rearward opening coach doors and a two-tone colour scheme that distinguishes between the upper and lower bodywork and frames the teak wood panelling of the convertible's tonneau cover. However, it eschews the EX's aluminium bonnet in favour of more easily maintained stainless steel.

4. Title: The Phantom Express. Fact: This story starts with engineer D.J. 'Smokey' Nolan played by J. Farrell MacDonald speeding down the tracks at full throttle when he spies an oncoming train directly in his path. He quickly applies the emergency brakes, the train starts screeching to a halt but then derails. Several passengers are killed. An investigation cannot find any trace of the oncoming train that caused the derailment. Smoky is fired for negligence.

5. Title: Rolls-Royce Phantom V. Fact: Based on the Silver Cloud II, it shared a V8 engine and General Motors Hydra-Matic automatic gearbox with that model. Rolls-Royce assembled the cars' chassis and drivetrains with bodies made to standard designs by coachbuilders Park Ward, and James Young, former vendors absorbed by Rolls-Royce.

Question: what is the average depth of the red sea
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Red Sea. Fact: The Red Sea has a surface area of roughly 438,000 km2 (169,100 mi2), is about 2250 km (1398 mi) long and, at its widest point, 355 km (220.6 mi) wide. It has a maximum depth of 3,040 m (9,970 ft) in the central Suakin Trough, and an average depth of 490 m (1,608 ft). However, there are also extensive shallow shelves, noted for their marine life and corals. The sea is the habitat of over 1,000 invertebrate species, and 200 soft and hard corals. It is the world's northernmost tropical sea.

2. Title: Arabian Sea. Fact: The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Peninsula, on the southeast by the Laccadive Sea, on the southwest by the Somali Sea, and on the east by India. Its total area is 3,862,000 km (1,491,000 sq mi) and its maximum depth is 4,652 meters (15,262 ft). The Gulf of Aden in the west connects the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf.

3. Title: Gulf of Aqaba. Fact: The gulf is east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian Peninsula. With the Gulf of Suez to the west, it extends from the northern portion of the Red Sea. It reaches a maximum depth of 1,850 m in its central area: the Gulf of Suez is significantly wider but less than 100 m deep.

4. Title: Dead Sea. Fact: Its surface and shores are below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. It is deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water – 9.6 times as salty as the ocean – and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is long and wide at its widest point.

5. Title: Red Sea (state). Fact: Geographically, in the east, bordering the state, is the Red Sea. Inland, mountains run from north to south, which are interrupted by arid plains. To the northwest is the Nubian Desert. The Siyal Islands are located in the disputed area between Egypt and Sudan in the northeast.

Question: who sang lead vocals on hold the line
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hold the Line. Fact: "Hold the Line" is a song by the American rock band Toto. The song was written by the band's keyboardist David Paich, and the lead vocals were performed by Bobby Kimball. The song was released as the band's debut single, and was featured on their debut 1978 eponymous album. The song was a huge success in the U.S.; it reached Number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the winter of 1978–79, and Number 14 on the official UK chart.

2. Title: Hold the Line (Jeanette song). Fact: "Hold The Line" is a pop song performed by German singer Jeanette. The song was written by Frank Johnes, Bodybrain and Wonderbra, and produced by Tom Remm and Frank Kretschmer for Jeanette's fourth album "Break On Through" (2003). It was released as a single on 28 June 2004 in Germany.

3. Title: End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song). Fact: "End of the Line" is a song by the British-American supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. Released in October 1988, it was the final track on their debut album, "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1". It was also issued as the band's second single, in January 1989. The recording features all the Wilburys except Bob Dylan as lead singers: George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison sing the choruses in turn, while Tom Petty sings the verses. The song was mainly written by Harrison and was assigned to his publishing company, Umlaut Corporation. In keeping with the collaborative concept behind the Wilburys project, however, all five members received a songwriting credit.

4. Title: Draw the Line (song). Fact: The song encompasses many of the typical things Aerosmith is known for, including the strong rhythm backbeat by Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer, the back-and-forth interplay between guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford. The song slows down before building to a climax showcasing Steven Tyler's trademark scream.

5. Title: Stand in Line. Fact: Whitney Z. Gomes at AllMusic gave "Stand in Line" four stars out of five, noting "Secret Lover", "Tonight I Fly", "Goodnight and Goodbye" and the title track as highlights. He mainly praised singer Graham Bonnet's vocals throughout the album, but heavily criticized the guitarist and bandleader Chris Impellitteri's cover versions of "Since You Been Gone" and "Over the Rainbow" as "excessive and useless", writing that they "almost [run] the record into the ground". Further criticism was directed at the album's mixing and production, but he concluded by saying, "When "Stand in Line" works, it rules."

Question: the clause that allows the federal government to expand its powers is the
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Enumerated powers. Fact: Interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause has been controversial, especially during the early years of the republic. Strict constructionists interpret the clause to mean that Congress may make a law only if the inability to do so would cripple its ability to apply one of its enumerated powers. Loose constructionists, on the other hand, believe it is largely up to Congress and not the courts to determine what means are "necessary and proper" to executing one of its enumerated powers. It is often known as the "elastic clause" because of the great amount of leeway in interpretation it allows; depending on the interpretation, it can be "stretched" to expand the powers of Congress, or allowed to "contract", limiting Congress. In practical usage, the clause has been paired with the Commerce Clause in particular to provide the constitutional basis for a wide variety of federal laws.

2. Title: Vesting Clauses. Fact: In United States constitutional law, the Vesting Clauses are three provisions in the United States Constitution which vest the United States' legislative power in the United States Congress, the executive power in the President, and judicial power in the Federal judiciary of the United States. The Constitution thus explicitly creates a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government of the United States.

3. Title: Section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Fact: Section 91(27) is by and large the broadest of the enumerated powers allocated to the federal government. As noted by Estey J. in "Scowby v. Glendinning":

4. Title: Limited government. Fact: The Constitution of the United States presents an example of the U.S. federal government not possessing any power except what is delegated to it by the Constitution — with the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution making explicit that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved for the people and the states.

5. Title: War Powers Clause. Fact: Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States Constitution, sometimes referred to as the War Powers Clause, vests in the Congress the power to declare war, in the following wording:

Question: Which footballing city beat the Netherlands in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 1974 UEFA Cup Final. Fact: The 1974 UEFA Cup Final was played on 21 May 1974 and 29 May 1974 between Tottenham Hotspur of England and Feyenoord of the Netherlands. Feyenoord won 4–2 on aggregate. Tottenham supporters rioted during the second leg in Rotterdam, which started after Feyenoord scored towards the end of the first half and continued into the second half.

2. Title: 1974 FIFA World Cup Final. Fact: The 1974 FIFA World Cup Final was the final match of the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the 10th FIFA World Cup, a competition to determine the world champion among national men's football sides. The match was contested by the Netherlands and West Germany, with the West Germans winning 2–1. The Netherlands opened the scoring via a Johan Neeskens penalty in the second minute, only for Paul Breitner to equalise with another penalty in the 25th minute before Gerd Müller scored the winning goal in the 43rd minute, claiming West Germany's second FIFA World Cup.

3. Title: 1970 European Cup Final. Fact: The 1970 European Cup Final was a football match held at the San Siro, Milan, on 6 May 1970, that saw Feyenoord of the Netherlands defeat Celtic of Scotland 2–1 after extra time. Ove Kindvall's goal in the 117th minute meant the trophy was going to a Dutch club for the first time. It remains Feyenoord's only European Cup triumph. The match nearly never took place due to massive strikes throughout Italy during 1970 (The Italian FA backed down to ensure that their own clubs would be able to compete in further UEFA competitions). A match programme was never issued for this final; it is unknown whether one was ever printed.

4. Title: 1973 European Cup Final. Fact: The 1973 European Cup Final was a football match held at the Red Star Stadium, Belgrade, on 30 May 1973, in which Ajax of the Netherlands defeated Juventus of Italy 1–0. A goal from Johnny Rep four minutes into the match was enough for Ajax to claim their third consecutive European Cup. This victory meant that Ajax had earned the privilege of keeping the trophy permanently. Juventus, however, got revenge 23 years later beating Ajax in the 1996 final in Rome.

5. Title: Football in Munich. Fact: Munich is one of the most successful footballing cities in Europe and the World with over 40 trophies, including Germany's victory in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final.

Question: Jacques-Louis was a founding member of the geological society before returning to France after what period of French history that followed the fall of Napoleon in 1814 until the July revolution of what year?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jacques Louis, Comte de Bournon. Fact: Jacques-Louis, Comte de Bournon FRS, FGS (January 21, 1751 – 24 August 1825) was a French soldier and mineralogist who came to England after the French Revolution. He gained prominence in the scientific community, being elected a fellow of the Royal Society and was a founding member of the Geological Society before returning to France after the Bourbon Restoration.

2. Title: Bourbon Restoration. Fact: The Bourbon Restoration was the period of French history following the fall of Napoleon in 1814 until the July Revolution of 1830. The brothers of executed Louis XVI of France came to power and reigned in highly conservative fashion, and exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France. They were nonetheless unable to reverse most of the changes made by the French Revolution and Napoleon.  At the Congress of Vienna they were treated respectfully, but had to give up all the territorial gains made since 1789.

3. Title: Timeline of the Napoleonic era. Fact: Napoleon Bonaparte (15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

4. Title: Napoleon. Fact: Napoléon Bonaparte (, ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.

5. Title: French Government of the Hundred Days. Fact: Napoleon left his exile on Elba and landed on the mainland near Cannes on 1 March 1815.

Question: when did charles darwin publish his theory of evolution
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Charles Darwin. Fact: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book "On the Origin of Species". By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.

2. Title: The Theory of Evolution. Fact: The Theory of Evolution is a book by English evolutionary biologist and geneticist John Maynard Smith, originally published in 1958 in time for 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the centenary of the publication of "The Origin of Species" the following year. It serves as a general introduction to the eponymous subject, intended to be accessible to those with little technical knowledge of the area. It has been highly successful, considered by many as the definitive publication of its type. The original version was updated several times, and a "Canto" edition, with a foreword by Richard Dawkins, and newly written introduction by the author, was published in 1996.

3. Title: Publication of Darwin's theory. Fact: On the Origin of Species was first published on 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray's autumn sale on 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, 1,192 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie's Library, ensuring that the book would be widely circulated.

4. Title: Charles Darwin. Fact: Charles Robert Darwin, (; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.

5. Title: Development of Darwin's theory. Fact: Following the inception of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection in 1838, the development of Darwin's theory to explain the "mystery of mysteries" of how new species originated was his "prime hobby" in the background to his main occupation of publishing the scientific results of the "Beagle" voyage. He was settling into married life, but suffered from bouts of illness and after his first child was born the family moved to rural Down House as a family home away from the pressures of London.

Question: when did the beatles come to the us
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Beatles in the United States. Fact: The Beatles' rise to prominence in the United States in February 1964 was a significant development in the history of the band's commercial success. In addition to establishing the Beatles' international stature, it changed attitudes to popular music in the United States, whose own Memphis-driven musical evolution had made it a global trend-setter.

2. Title: The Beatles' North American releases. Fact: It was nearly a year before the Beatles became widely popular in America. "CBS Evening News" aired a five-minute news story about Beatlemania in the UK on 10 December 1963; this led to a teenage girl making an airplay request of a local radio station, which in turn sparked a sequence of events leading to the rush-release of the single "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and the group's commercial breakthrough.

3. Title: The Beatles. Fact: Led by the band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had been together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of "fifth Beatle".

4. Title: Liverpool Five. Fact: The Liverpool Five were a beat group that was part of the British Invasion-era of the 1960s. The five members of the band went to the United States by way of Japan in 1965.

5. Title: The Beatles' 1965 US tour. Fact: After the tour's conclusion, the Beatles took a six-week break before reconvening in mid-October to record the album "Rubber Soul".

Question: when did the new york times start publishing
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The New York Times. Fact: The New York Times (sometimes abbreviated NYT and The Times) is an American daily newspaper, founded and continuously published in New York City since September 18, 1851, by The New York Times Company. The New York Times has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The paper's print version in 2013 had the second-largest circulation, behind The Wall Street Journal, and the largest circulation among the metropolitan newspapers in the United States. The New York Times is ranked 18th in the world by circulation. Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.

2. Title: New York World. Fact: The New York World was a newspaper published in New York City from 1860 until 1931. The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it was a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention with sensation, sports, sex and scandal and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark. It was sold in 1930 and merged into the New York World-Telegram.

3. Title: New Times (magazine). Fact: Hirsch had been publisher of "New York" magazine, but resigned after conflicts with founder/editor Clay Felker. "New Times" began as a bridge between the newsweeklies and the more reflective monthly opinion magazines, notably "Harper's" and "The Atlantic". The first issue appeared in October 1972. Initially, the magazine featured a marquee roster of the era's best-known "new journalists," including Jimmy Breslin, Pete Hamill, Jack Newfield, Mike Royko, and Dick Schaap.

4. Title: The New York Observer. Fact: The "Observer" was first published in New York City on September 22, 1987, as a weekly newspaper by Arthur L. Carter, a former investment banker.

5. Title: The New Yorker. Fact: "The New Yorker" was founded by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, a "New York Times" reporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably "corny" humor publications such as "Judge", where he had worked, or the old "Life". Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: "It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque."

Question: how many world series wins does boston have
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Boston Red Sox. Fact: The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in twelve. In addition, they won the 1904 American League pennant, but were not able to defend their 1903 world championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in a World Series. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The "Red Sox" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, around 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the "Boston Red Stockings", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves.

2. Title: New England Nine. Fact: The NewEngland Nine is a very famous nine. Led by Andrew Beaton, the New England Nine brought Boston its first World Series since 1918.

3. Title: 2013 World Series. Fact: The 2013 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2013 season. The 109th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals; the Red Sox won, 4 games to 2. The Red Sox had home field advantage for the series, based on the AL's win in the 2013 MLB All-Star Game on July 16. This was the first World Series since 1999 to feature both #1 seeds from the American League and National League. The Series started on Wednesday, October 23, ending on Game 6 the following Wednesday, October 30, 2013.

4. Title: World Series. Fact: Prior to 1969, the team with the best regular-season win-loss record in each league automatically advanced to the World Series; since then each league has conducted a championship series (ALCS and NLCS) preceding the World Series to determine which teams will advance. Those series have, in turn, been preceded by division series (ALDS and NLDS) since 1995, and by wild card games since 2012. As of 2019, the World Series has been contested 115 times, with the AL winning 66 and the NL winning 49.

5. Title: 2018 Boston Red Sox season. Fact: The team set a new franchise record for wins in a season by surpassing the prior mark of 105 that had been set in 1912; they also won the most games by any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116. Mookie Betts finished the season with the Major League batting title, hitting .346, while J. D. Martinez finished second in the majors with .330. Betts also won a Gold Glove and the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award. Closer Craig Kimbrel became the fastest player in history to reach 300 career saves, finishing the season with 333.

Question: who took hat trick in both innings of a test match
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of Test cricket hat-tricks. Fact: A player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career. During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match. Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.

2. Title: List of One Day International cricket hat-tricks. Fact: A hat-trick in cricket is when a bowler takes three wickets on consecutive deliveries, dismissing three different batsmen. It is a relatively rare event in One Day International (ODI) cricket with only 49 occurrences in 4222 matches since the first ever ODI match between Australia and England on 5 January 1971. The first ODI hat-trick was taken by Pakistan's Jalal-ud-Din against Australia in Hyderabad, Sindh, in September 1982. The most recent player to achieve this feat is Kuldeep Yadav of India against West Indies in December 2019.

3. Title: Jimmy Matthews. Fact: Thomas James Matthews (3 April 1884 – 14 October 1943) was an Australian Test cricketer. Bowling leg breaks, he is the only player to have taken two hat tricks in the same Test match.

4. Title: Peter Petherick. Fact: Peter James Petherick (25 September 1942 – 7 June 2015) was a New Zealand cricketer who represented New Zealand in six Test cricket matches between October 1976 and March 1977 as an off-spinner. He is one of two New Zealand bowlers to achieve a hat-trick in Test matches. He is one of only three players, along with Maurice Allom and Damien Fleming, to have taken a hat-trick on Test debut.

5. Title: Double (cricket). Fact: Wilfred Rhodes performed the double more often than anyone else, 16 times. George Hirst achieved the feat on 14 occasions, including a unique "double double" in 1906 of 2385 runs and 208 wickets. Jim Parks senior managed the unique double of 3000 runs and 100 wickets in 1937. Maurice Tate, who scored 1193 runs and took 116 wickets during the MCC tour of India and Ceylon in 1926-27, is the only cricketer to achieve the feat outside England.

Question: is the electoral college only for presidential elections
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Presidential Electoral College. Fact: It consists of three separate committees:

2. Title: United States Electoral College. Fact: The United States Electoral College is a body of electors established by the United States Constitution, constituted every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and an absolute majority of 270 electoral votes is required to win an election. Pursuant to Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, the legislature of each state determines the manner by which its electors are chosen. Each state's number of electors is equal to the combined total of the state's membership in the Senate and House of Representatives; currently there are 100 senators and 435 representatives. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to a number of electors no greater than that of the least populous state (i.e., 3).

3. Title: United States presidential election. Fact: The Electoral College and its procedure are established in the U.S. Constitution by Article II, Section 1, Clauses 2 and 4; and the Twelfth Amendment (which replaced Clause3 after its ratification in 1804). Under Clause2, each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress, while (per the Twenty-third Amendment, ratified in 1961) Washington, D.C., casts the same number of electoral votes as the least-represented state, which is three. Also under Clause2, the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature, not directly by the federal government. Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly, but over time all of them switched to using the popular vote to help determine electors, which persists today. Once chosen, electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the plurality in their state, but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as "faithless" or "unpledged" electors. In modern times, faithless and unpledged electors have not affected the ultimate outcome of an election, so the results can generally be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote.

4. Title: Unpledged elector. Fact: In United States presidential elections, an unpledged elector is a person nominated to stand as an elector but who has not pledged to support any particular presidential or vice presidential candidate, and is free to vote for any candidate when elected a member of the Electoral College. Presidential elections are indirect, with voters in each state choosing electors on Election Day in November, and these electors choosing the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in December. Electors today are elected in every state by popular vote, and in practice have since the 19th century almost always agreed in advance to vote for a particular candidate — that is, they are said to have been "pledged" to that candidate. In the 20th century, however, several elections were contested by unpledged electors, who made no pledge to any candidate before the election. These anomalies largely arose from fissures within the Democratic Party over the issues of civil rights and segregation. No serious general election campaign has been mounted to elect unpledged electors in any state since 1964.

5. Title: List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin. Fact: The margin of victory in a U.S. presidential election, with the exception below, would be the difference between the number of electoral votes won by the candidate with at least a majority of electoral votes (currently 270 of 538) and the number received by the second place candidate. Theoretically this number would be in the range of 2 to 538. The numbers above assume that all electors vote.

Question: when did women earn the right to vote
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Timeline of women's suffrage. Fact: Some women in the Isle of Man (geographically part of the British Isles but not part of the United Kingdom) gained the right to vote in 1881. Though it did not achieve nationhood until 1907, the colony of New Zealand was the first self-governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in, but not to stand for, parliamentary elections in 1893, followed closely by the colony of South Australia in 1894 (which, unlike New Zealand, allowed women to stand for Parliament). In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was granted during the age of liberty between 1718 and 1772.

2. Title: Women's suffrage. Fact: The United States gave women equal voting rights in all states with the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in 1920. Canada and a few Latin American nations passed women's suffrage before World War II while the vast majority of Latin American nations established women's suffrage in the 1940s (see table in Summary below). The last Latin American country to give women the right to vote was Paraguay in 1961.

3. Title: Timeline of women's suffrage. Fact: Women's suffrage – the right of women to vote – has been achieved at various times in countries throughout the world. In many nations, women's suffrage was granted before universal suffrage, so women and men from certain classes or races were still unable to vote. Some countries granted suffrage to both sexes at the same time. This timeline lists years when women's suffrage was enacted. Some countries are listed more than once, as the right was extended to more women according to age, land ownership, etc. In many cases, the first voting took place in a subsequent year.

4. Title: Women's suffrage in states of the United States. Fact: Women's suffrage in states of the United States refers to women's right to vote in individual states of that country. Suffrage was established on a full or partial basis by various towns, counties, states and territories during the latter decades of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century. As women received the right to vote in some places, they began running for public office and gaining positions as school board members, county clerks, state legislators, judges, and, in the case of Jeannette Rankin, as a Member of Congress.

5. Title: Women's suffrage in Canada. Fact: Municipal suffrage was granted in 1884 to property-owning widows and spinsters in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario; in 1886, in the province of New Brunswick, to all property-owning women except those whose husbands were voters; in Nova Scotia, in 1886; and in Prince Edward Island, in 1888, to property-owning widows and spinsters.

Question: The French Air Force aircraft engine series Hispano-Suiza V-12's last two models were used mainly around what war(s)?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Hispano-Suiza 12Y. Fact: The Hispano-Suiza 12Y was an aircraft engine produced by Hispano-Suiza for the French Air Force in the pre-WWII period. The 12Y became the primary French 1,000 hp (750 kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Dewoitine D.520. Its design was based on the earlier and somewhat smaller, 12X. A further development was under way, the 12Z, but ended due to the German occupation of France.

2. Title: Hispano-Suiza 12Z. Fact: The 12Z, designated Type 89 by the company, was the final evolution of the series of Hispano-Suiza V-12 aircraft engines. The Z model had just entered production when France fell to the Germans during World War II. A small number were produced during the war but the German occupation government would not allow full-scale production to start. After the war small numbers were built to equip new designs, but the rapid introduction of the jet engine ended further development.

3. Title: French Air Force. Fact: The French Air Force ( ; ) is the air force of the French Armed Forces. It was formed in 1909 as the "Service Aéronautique", a service arm of the French Army, then was made an independent military arm in 1934. The number of aircraft in service with the French Air Force varies depending on source, however sources from the French Ministry of Defence give a figure of 658 aircraft in 2014. The French Air Force has 225 combat aircraft in service, with the majority being 117 Dassault Mirage 2000 and 108 Dassault Rafale. As of early 2017, the French Air Force employs a total of 41,160 regular personnel. The reserve element of the air force consisted of 5,187 personnel of the Operational Reserve.

4. Title: Hanriot LH.10. Fact: Early members of the family all had radial engines, but the definitive LH.16 of 1933 had an inline engine within a neat cowling. This type was evaluated by the "Armée de l'Air" and an initial order for 60 machines was placed. This was soon amended to just 15 in the original trainer configuration, plus another 29 modified as observation aircraft with a mounting for a trainable machine gun in the rear cockpit. Following a brief career in military service, the H.16s were turned over to the "Aviation Populaire" for use as trainers.

5. Title: Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard. Fact: The aircraft is an advanced development of the Étendard IVM, which it replaced. The Super Étendard first flew in October 1974 and entered French service in June 1978. French Super Étendards have served in several conflicts such as the Kosovo war, the war in Afghanistan and the military intervention in Libya.

Question: which party was in power in u.k. when india became independent
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Political history of the United Kingdom (1945–present). Fact: For decades the Conservatives were split on India between die-hard imperialists (led by Churchill) and moderate elements who tried to provide limited local control.  Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharial Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated. The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. Historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a "national humiliation" but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs.  Whereas Churchill in 1940-45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonization.  Attlee found that Churchill's viceroy, Field Marshal Wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions (he wanted seven more Army divisions) and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing  war hero and a cousin of the King. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu activist in January 1948.

2. Title: Interim Government of India. Fact: After the end of the Second World War, the British authorities in India released all political prisoners who had participated in the Quit India movement. The Indian National Congress, the largest Indian political party, which had long fought for national independence, agreed to participate in elections for a constituent assembly, as did the Muslim League. The newly elected government of Clement Attlee dispatched the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India to formulate proposals for the formation of a government that would lead to an independent India.

3. Title: UK Independence Party. Fact: UKIP originated as the Anti-Federalist League, a single-issue Eurosceptic party established in London by Alan Sked in 1991. It was renamed UKIP in 1993 but its growth remained slow. It was largely eclipsed by the Eurosceptic Referendum Party until the latter's 1997 dissolution. In 1997, Sked was ousted by a faction led by Nigel Farage, who became the party's preeminent figure. In 2006, Farage officially became leader and under his direction the party adopted a wider policy platform and capitalised on concerns about rising immigration, in particular among the White British working class. This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 local elections, 2014 European elections, and 2015 general election. The pressure UKIP exerted on the government was the main reason for the 2016 referendum which led to the UK's commitment to withdraw from the European Union. Farage then stepped down as UKIP leader, and the party's vote share and membership heavily declined. Following repeat leadership crises, Gerard Batten took over. Under Batten, UKIP moved into far-right territory by emphasising an anti-Islam message. At this, many longstanding members–including Farage–left and joined the new Brexit Party.

4. Title: Liberal Party (UK). Fact: The Liberal Party was one of the two major parties in the United Kingdom with the opposing Conservative Party in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The party arose from an alliance of Whigs and free trade-supporting Peelites and the reformist Radicals in the 1850s. By the end of the 19th century, it had formed four governments under William Gladstone. Despite being divided over the issue of Irish Home Rule, the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in the following year's general election.

5. Title: Janata Party. Fact: The Janata Party (JNP, translation: "People's Party") was an amalgam of Indian political parties opposed to the Emergency that was imposed between 1975 and 1977 by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of the Indian National Congress. In the 1977 general election, the party defeated the Congress and Janata leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister in independent modern India's history.

Regular team captain Paul Merton stood in as the host of the first episode following Deayton's departure, following which the programme was presented by a different guest host each week (many of which have presented several editions of the show). This was initially intended as a short-term solution while producers were looking for a full-time replacement; however, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million. It was therefore announced in June 2003 that this feature would continue.

He has appeared on many radio and television programmes, and has been a team captain on the BBC quiz show "Have I Got News for You" since the programme's inception in 1990.

4. Title: News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald. Fact: News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald, more commonly referred to as simply News Knight is a British television panel show shown on ITV, at 22:00 on Sunday nights. Fronted by Sir Trevor McDonald and in a similar style to the BBC One programme "Have I Got News for You", its format featured three comedians and McDonald satirising the week's news. Marcus Brigstocke was a permanent member of the "news team".

5. Title: Ross Noble. Fact: Ross Markham Noble (born 5 June 1976) is an English stand-up comedian and actor.

Question: did manny from ice age have a family
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of Ice Age characters. Fact: Manfred "Manny", is a woolly mammoth, in all five Ice Age films. His personality is shown to be aloof, grumpy, and standoffish, but is otherwise loving and courageous. In the first film, while passing through the icy cave, the herd discovers cave paintings of Manny with his wife and child, who were killed by humans; this is a very sentimental moment for Manny, since he failed to protect them. Manny finds love with Ellie in Ice Age: The Meltdown. In Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, he is anxious when Ellie is pregnant. At the end of the film, he becomes the proud father of a baby daughter named Peaches. In Ice Age: Continental Drift, he gets into an argument with his teenage daughter before being pulled away in by the drift with Diego, Sid and Granny. He and the team later encounter a group of pirates led by Captain Gutt. When the team escaped they destroy the ship and take Shira with them. This enrages the Captain who hunts them down. Later on, he is almost manipulated by sirens.

2. Title: Manny Gómez. Fact: Gómez was just two years old when he and his family moved to Victoria, British Columbia. Both of his parents were born in Mendoza, Argentina.

3. Title: Manny (TV series). Fact: Kim Yi-han is a manny, a male nanny, from New York. Due to some mishaps, he has to find work in South Korea while he is stuck there for a while. Seo Do-young is the divorced mother of Oh Eun-bi and Oh Jung-min. Her children's antics have scared away all former nannies. She works in the fashion industry, living under her elder sister Janice's iron rule. Janice is the somewhat self-centered head of her own modelling agency, pushing herself and all her connections in competing in the field. Circumstances bring them together, and the result is sometimes funny, sometimes serious, and all-round interesting to watch.

4. Title: The Manny. Fact: Single father Clemens (Matthias Schweighöfer) is shunned by all nanny services, because his two children Winnie and Theo (Paula Hartmann and Arved Friese) are impossible to babysit: they prank, bully and terrify any lady who dares to enter their mansion. But finding a nanny is hardly Clemens' number one priority, being preoccupied by his urban development which requires the demolition of an apartment building, something bitterly opposed by its residents. One of the victims, Rolf (Milan Peschel), pays Clemens a visit to voice his protest, but is mistaken as the new nanny — or manny in his case. Rolf believes it a good opportunity to sabotage Clemens' development plans, and accepts the offer. Predictably he suffers at the hands of the unruly children, but over time wins their hearts with his goofiness and sincerity. He discovers that the root of the kids' problems is that Clemens is never home. To help bring the family together, Rolf tries to show Clemens — including taking Clemens to visit his small community — that there are things more important than money in the world.

5. Title: Manny Pérez. Fact: Pérez was born in Baitoa, Santiago, Dominican Republic and currently lives in Washington Heights, Manhattan.

Question: when did houston move to the national league
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of the Houston Astros. Fact: From 1888 until 1961, Houston's professional baseball club was the minor league Houston Buffaloes. Although expansion from the National League eventually brought a Major League team to Texas in 1962, Houston officials had been making efforts to do so for years prior. There were four men chiefly responsible for bringing Major League Baseball to Houston: George Kirksey and Craig Cullinan, who had led a futile attempt to purchase the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952; R.E. "Bob" Smith, a prominent oilman and real estate magnate in Houston who was brought in for his financial resources; and Judge Roy Hofheinz, a former Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge who was recruited for his salesmanship and political style. They formed the Houston Sports Association as their vehicle for attaining a big league franchise for the city of Houston.

2. Title: Houston Astros. Fact: The Houston Astros are an American professional baseball team based in Houston, Texas. The Astros compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division, having moved to the division in 2013 after spending their first 51 seasons in the National League (NL). The Astros have played their home games at Minute Maid Park since 2000.

3. Title: List of Houston Astros managers. Fact: The Houston Astros are a professional baseball franchise based in Houston, Texas. They are a member of the American League (AL) West in Major League Baseball (MLB). The team joined MLB in 1962 as an expansion team named the Houston Colt .45s and changed their name to the Houston Astros in 1965. The team won their first NL Championship in 2005. Having first played in Colt Stadium (1962–1964), and later in The Astrodome, now known as the Reliant Astrodome (1965–1999), the Astros have played their home games at Minute Maid Park, which was first named The Ballpark at Union Station, since 2000. The franchise is owned by Jim Crane, and Jeff Luhnow is their general manager.

4. Title: 1962 Major League Baseball expansion. Fact: The 1962 Major League Baseball expansion was the formation of two new Major League Baseball (MLB) teams for the 1962 season. The Houston Colt .45s (later renamed the Astros) and the New York Mets were added to the National League (NL), becoming the 19th and 20th teams in MLB's two leagues. The Colt .45s were the first major league team in Houston while the Mets filled the void left when the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers of the NL moved to California after the 1957 season.

5. Title: 1961 Major League Baseball expansion. Fact: The expansion was part of an initiative in response to the perceived threat of a proposed third major league, the Continental League. In 1962, the National League (NL) also added two new teams, the Houston Colt .45s (later named the Astros) and the New York Mets.

Question: where were the desert scenes in stargate filmed
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Stargate (film). Fact: The film in its original cut plays out in chronological order, but when Devlin and Emmerich edited the film in the director's cut to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. Only Davidson's upper torso was filmed because Davidson had refused to take out his nipple rings. The first scene was a combination of model shots and a set in Yuma, Arizona where Rambo III had been filmed. The scene of the excavation of the Stargate was also filmed in three days in Arizona. A golden look was achieved by filming near the time of sunset. To keep within the limit of the budget, the producers put stick figures with cloth in the distant desert to appear as humans. The original Stargate was painted black, but it looked like a giant tire so it was repainted silver at the last moment.

2. Title: Stargate Studios. Fact: It is a production company offering visual effects and production services to the film and television industry with studios in Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver, Atlanta, Malta, London, Cologne, Dubai, and Mexico City

3. Title: Mos Eisley. Fact: Scenes set in Mos Eisley made a particular impact on audiences as they included a noted scene in an insalubrious cantina frequented by numerous alien races.

Question: who killed han in fast and furious tokyo drift
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Han Lue. Fact: Han's death is seen again in Furious 7 through archival footage from The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious 6, occurring the same time a bomb package delivered to Dominic's house goes off. Han's death was the reason Dominic appeared in Tokyo at the end of Tokyo Drift - to retrieve his body back to Los Angeles for burial. After racing with Sean Boswell, Dominic receives several of Han's personal items, including a photo of Gisele. The crew attended Han's funeral in Los Angeles a few days later, with Dominic spying Han's killer Deckard Shaw watching from a distance, and giving chase, leading to their confrontation.

2. Title: Tetsuya Shiroo. Fact: On April 17, 2007, Shiroo shot Iccho Itoh, the mayor of Nagasaki, who died early the next morning.

3. Title: Tetsuya Shiroo. Fact: Shiroo's apparent motive for the assassination was a grudge over an insurance claim. City officials had refused to compensate him for a Yamaguchi-gumi vehicle that was damaged at a public works construction site in 2003. It was reported in the Japanese press that prior to the shooting, Shiroo had mailed a letter to TV Asahi outlining his grudges against the mayor and the city government. In addition to the insurance claim, Shiroo was also reportedly angry that a construction company linked to his gang had been denied a contract by the city government. He later told police that he had been planning the assassination since February.

4. Title: Inejiro Asanuma. Fact: Asanuma was assassinated with a "yoroi-dōshi", a traditional sword, by ultranationalist Otoya Yamaguchi while speaking in a televised political debate in Tokyo. His violent death was seen in graphic detail on national television, causing widespread public shock and outrage.

Question: The Little Western Wall, also known as HaKotel HaKatan (or just Kotel Katan) and the Small Kotel, is a Jewish religious site located in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, it is the continuation of the larger part of the Western Wall and almost exactly faces the Holy of Holies, a term in the Hebrew Bible which refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle, where who dwelt?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Little Western Wall. Fact: The Little Western Wall, also known as HaKotel HaKatan (or just Kotel Katan) and the Small Kotel, (Hebrew: הכותל הקטן‎), is a Jewish religious site located in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem near the Iron Gate to the Temple Mount. The wall itself dates from the Second Temple period, (516 BCE – 70 CE). It is the continuation of the larger part of the Western Wall and almost exactly faces the Holy of Holies. HaKotel HaKatan is not as well-known and not as crowded as the larger part of the Western Wall. This section of the wall is of deep spiritual significance because of its close proximity to the Holy of Holies. However, it is not the closest location to the Holy of Holies, as there is a location in the Western Wall Tunnel which directly faces the Holy of Holies.

2. Title: Holy of Holies. Fact: The Holy of Holies (Tiberian Hebrew: קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm) is a term in the Hebrew Bible which refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle where God dwelt.  The Ark is said to have contained the Ten Commandments, which were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. It is thought to be located under the Dome of the Rock.

3. Title: Western Wall. Fact: The Western Wall, Wailing Wall, or Kotel , known in Islam as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: "Ḥā’iṭ al-Burāq" حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق ), is an ancient limestone wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the "Western Wall". The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great, which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a large rectangular structure topped by a huge flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself and its auxiliary buildings. For Muslims, it is traditionally the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, al-Buraq, on his Isra and Mi'raj to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the Western border of "al-Haram al-Sharif".

4. Title: Western Wall. Fact: The Western Wall is considered holy due to its connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the holiest site in the Jewish faith lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.

5. Title: Middot (Talmud). Fact: Tractate Middot (, lit. "Measurements") is the tenth tractate of "Seder Kodashim" ("Order of Holies") of the Mishnah and of the Talmud. This tractate describes the dimensions and the arrangement of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and the Second Temple buildings and courtyards, various gates, the altar of sacrifice and its surroundings, and the places where the Priests and Levites kept watch in the Temple.

Question: what was tom's wife name on the jeffersons
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Martha Jefferson. Fact: The couple had six children. Only two daughters, Martha and Mary, lived to adulthood. Weakened by childbirth, Martha died several months after the birth of her last child. Thomas adhered to her request not to remarry, though it is widely held that he had a long-standing relationship and children with her half-sister, Sally Hemings, a favored slave who was three-quarters white. After Martha's death, Thomas burned their letters to each other and rarely spoke of her, so she remains a somewhat enigmatic figure.

2. Title: List of The Jeffersons supporting characters. Fact: Helen Willis (née Douglas) (portrayed by Roxie Roker, except for her first appearance in All in the Family, when she was portrayed by Kim Hamilton) is Louise's best friend and George's worst nightmare. She has been married to Tom Willis for 34 years. Tom is white, and Helen is black, which was a renowned aspect of the show. George, disliking racially mixed-marriages, constantly called both Helen and Tom "zebra" or "chocolate and vanilla". Helen often strikes back by calling him "shorty." As well, George enjoys calling Tom "honky", but he learned to get along with the two in later years during the sitcom. In the fourth season, Helen works with Louise as volunteers at a social service facility called "The Help Center", which opened in 1977. There is also a mention that she and Louise were the editors of the center's newsletter, a post the two decide to share after the drama of episode 67. Helen and Tom have two children: Jennifer "Jenny" Willis (Berlinda Tolbert) and Allan Willis (Jay Hammer and Andrew Rubin).

3. Title: Franklin Cover. Fact: Franklin Edward Cover (November 20, 1928 – February 5, 2006) was an American actor best known for starring in the sitcom "The Jeffersons". His character, Tom Willis, was half of one of the first interracial marriages to be seen on prime-time television.

4. Title: Mary Jefferson Eppes. Fact: Mary Jefferson was born to politician and future president Thomas Jefferson and Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson (née Wayles). Known as "Polly the Parrot" and "gopher" in her childhood, she later chose the nickname "Maria." She was known as such until her death at age 25.

5. Title: Sally Hemings. Fact: Sally Hemings came to Jefferson's home as an infant with her siblings and her mother, Betty, as part of his wife Martha's inheritance of slaves from her father, John Wayles. Hemings was the youngest of six children that Betty Hemings is believed to have had with Wayles. If true, she was three-quarters European and a half-sister of Martha Jefferson.

Question: who is considered to be the first pharaoh of egypt
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Pharaoh. Fact: Pharaoh (, ; "Pǝrro") is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE, although the actual term "Pharaoh" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah, c. 1200 BCE. In the early dynasty, ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles, the Horus, the Sedge and Bee ("nswt-bjtj") name, and the Two Ladies ("nbtj") name. The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added.

2. Title: Narmer. Fact: Narmer's identity is the subject of ongoing debates, although the dominant opinion among Egyptologists identifies Narmer with the pharaoh Menes, who is renowned in the ancient Egyptian written records as the first king, and the unifier of Ancient Egypt. Narmer's identification with Menes is based on the Narmer Palette (which shows Narmer as the unifier of Egypt) and the two necropolis seals from the Umm el-Qa'ab cemetery of Abydos that show him as the first king of the First Dynasty.

3. Title: Amenhotep I. Fact: Amenhotep I  ( /jama:nuḥa:tpaw/ "Amun is satisfied"; Amarna cuneiform a-ma-an-ha-at-pe or -at-pa) or Amenophis I, (,), from Ancient Greek Ἀμένωφις , additionally "King Zeserkere" (transliteration: "Ḏsr-k3-R`"), was the second Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC. He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari, but had at least two elder brothers, Ahmose-ankh and Ahmose Sapair, and was not expected to inherit the throne. However, sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I's 17th regnal year and his death, his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince. He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years.

4. Title: Menes. Fact: Menes (fl. c. 3200–3000 BC) (; , probably pronounced *; ) was a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period of ancient Egypt credited by classical tradition with having united Upper and Lower Egypt and as the founder of the First Dynasty.

5. Title: Amenhotep I. Fact: Although his reign is poorly documented, it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence. He inherited the kingdom formed by his father's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant. He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his from his mortuary temple, setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom. After his death, he was deified as a patron god of Deir el-Medina.

Question: the former soviet union broke into separate states
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Post-Soviet states. Fact: The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the states that emerged and re-emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its breakup in 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War. The three Baltic states were the first to declare their independence, between March and May 1990, claiming continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership.

2. Title: Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Fact: The dissolution of the Soviet Union was the process of internal disintegration within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also referred to as the Soviet Union, which began in the second half of the 1980s with growing unrest in the national republics and ended on 26 December 1991, when the USSR itself was voted out of existence by the Supreme Soviet, following the Belavezha Accords. Declaration number 142-Н by the Supreme Soviet resulted in self-governing independence to the Republics of the USSR, formally dissolving the USSR. The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do so at all. On the previous day, 25 December, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the eighth and final leader of the USSR, resigned, declared his office extinct and handed over its powers—including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes—to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. That evening at 7:32 p.m., the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary Russian flag.

3. Title: Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Fact: Previously, from August to December, all the individual republics, including Russia itself, had either seceded from the union or at the very least denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR. The week before formal dissolution, eleven republics signed the Alma-Ata Protocol formally establishing the CIS and declaring that the USSR had ceased to exist. Both the Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the USSR also marked the end of the Cold War.

4. Title: Soviet Union. Fact: The Soviet Union, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics, in practice its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). Other major urban centers were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, Alma-Ata, and Novosibirsk. It spanned over 10,000 kilometers (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500 mi) north to south. Its territory included much of Eastern Europe, as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia. It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert and mountains.

5. Title: Republics of the Soviet Union. Fact: The Republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or Union Republics  were the ethnically based proto-states of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). For most of its history, the USSR was a highly centralized state; the decentralization reforms during the era of "Perestroika" ("Restructuring") and "Glasnost" ("Openness") conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev are cited as one of the factors which led to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.

Question: is a wooly mammoth the same as a mastodon
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Woolly mammoth. Fact: The woolly mammoth ("Mammuthus primigenius") is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene until its extinction in the early Holocene epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with "Mammuthus subplanifrons" in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.

2. Title: Mastodon. Fact: Modern reconstructions based on partial and skeletal remains reveal that mastodons were very similar in appearance to elephants and, to a lesser degree, mammoths, though not closely related to either one. Compared to mammoths, mastodons had shorter legs, a longer body and were more heavily muscled, a build similar to that of the current Asian elephants. The average body size of the species M. americanum was around 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) in height at the shoulders, corresponding to a large female or a small male; large males were up to 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) in height. Among the largest male specimens, the 35-year-old AMNH 9950 was 2.89 metres (9.5 ft) tall and weighed 7.8 tonnes (7.7 long tons; 8.6 short tons), while another was 3.25 metres (10.7 ft) tall and weighed 11 tonnes (11 long tons; 12 short tons).

3. Title: Woolly mammoth. Fact: The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between and weighed up to . Females reached in shoulder heights and weighed up to . A newborn calf weighed about . The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and sedges. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.

4. Title: Mammoth. Fact: A mammoth is any species of the extinct genus Mammuthus, one of the many genera that make up the order of trunked mammals called proboscideans. The various species of mammoth were commonly equipped with long, curved tusks and, in northern species, a covering of long hair. They lived from the Pliocene epoch (from around 5 million years ago) into the Holocene at about 4,000 years ago, and various species existed in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. They were members of the family Elephantidae, which also contains the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors.

Summarily, the missions of the game take place (in order) on Hawke's Bay in New Zealand; at a racetrack in Miami; the fictional area of Santa Fortuna in Colombia; the slums of Mumbai; a fictional Vermont suburb; the fictional Isle of Sgàil somewhere in the North Atlantic; the fictional Milton-Fitzpatrick bank in New York City; and the fictional Haven Island resort in the Maldives.

3. Title: List of Reborn! episodes. Fact: The episodes of the "Reborn!" anime series, also known as "Katekyō Hitman Reborn!", is a Japanese television series directed by Kenichi Imaizumi and produced and animated by Artland. It first began airing in Japan on the television network TV Tokyo on October 7, 2006, and has since broadcast over 200 episodes, which are each referred to as a "Target". The anime is an adaptation of Akira Amano's manga series of the same name, which was first serialized in Japan's "Weekly Shōnen Jump" in 2004. The series centers around the life of Tsunayoshi "Tsuna" Sawada, a timid boy who learns he is the great-great-great grandson of the founder of the Italian Vongola Mafia family. Tsuna, who is the only living heir, must learn to become a proper Mafia boss and is required to undergo training from the Vongola's number one hitman, an infant named Reborn.

4. Title: Hitman (DC Comics). Fact: "Hitman" chronicles the exploits of Tommy Monaghan, an ex-Marine Gulf War veteran turned contract killer from the Cauldron, a lower-class Irish district of Gotham City. He first appears in "The Demon Annual" #2 (part of the "Bloodlines" crossover in the summer of 1993), when he is attacked and bitten by a Bloodlines parasite called Glonth. Instead of dying, the bite unexpectedly triggers his metagene and grants him x-ray vision and moderate telepathy. A side effect is that his corneas and irises are solid black, indistinguishable from his pupils; the sight managed to unnerve Batman when he first saw them. The inherited powers later come with limits, and Monaghan uses them selectively, both because of the difficulty of concentrating during an explosive firefight and the side effects of their extended use (which includes anything between a headache and a minor illness).

5. Title: Hitman (1998 film). Fact: In Hong Kong, a mysterious hitman known as the "King of Killers" has murdered a wealthy ex-yakuza crime boss named Tsukamoto. Because Tsukamoto had established a revenge fund in case of an assassination, a US $100 million bounty is placed upon the King. The deceased's power hungry grandson, Eiji, becomes the new head of the Tsukamoto family and one of the bounty hunters.

Question: Which Los Angeles formed American rock and pop band stared in the 1968 musical Head?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Doors. Fact: The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and his erratic stage persona, and the group was widely regarded as representative of the era's counterculture.

2. Title: The Mystery Trend. Fact: The group came to fruition in 1964 thanks to Ron Nagle (keyboards, vocals), an R&B enthusiast enamored with the recordings of Ray Charles. While studying at San Francisco State College, he met Larry Bennett (lead vocals), who also shared similar musical tastes. As the British Invasion brought rock and roll back to the conscience of San Francisco's pop audience, Nagle and Bennett formed the Terrazzo Brothers with fellow college students Bob Cuff (rhythm guitar), Mike Daly (bass guitar), and John Luby (drums). For the most part, the band tended to remove themselves from the music of the Beatles, instead playing interpretations of R&B songs. After a year, the Terrazzo Brothers saw Daly assume the role of manager, Bennett taking his former position, and newcomer Larry West (lead guitar) was brought in to fill the group's vacancy at guitar. The band swapped changed moniker to the Mystery Trend upon a misinterpretation of the "Mystery Tramp" featured in the lyrics to Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone".

3. Title: The Monkees. Fact: The Monkees are an American/English rock and pop band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British stage and television actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

4. Title: Nazz. Fact: The Nazz was an American rock band formed in Philadelphia in 1967. They were founded by guitarist and principal songwriter Todd Rundgren and bassist Carson Van Osten. Drummer Thom Mooney and vocalist/keyboardist Robert "Stewkey" Antoni joined before their first concert, opening for the Doors in 1967. They are best known for their debut single "Open My Eyes" backed with "Hello It's Me".

5. Title: Head (film). Fact: Head is a 1968 American satirical musical adventure film written by Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson, directed by Rafelson, starring television rock group The Monkees (Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith), and distributed by Columbia Pictures.

Question: why did european explorers seek a northwest passage
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Northwest Passage. Fact: For centuries, European explorers sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia. An ice-bound northern route was discovered in 1850 by the Irish explorer Robert McClure; it was through a more southerly opening in an area explored by the Scotsman John Rae in 1854 that Norwegian Roald Amundsen made the first complete passage in 1903–1906. Until 2009, the Arctic pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year. Arctic sea ice decline has rendered the waterways more navigable for ice navigation.

2. Title: Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest. Fact: Starting in the mid-18th century, Spain's claim began to be challenged in the form of British and Russian fur trading and colonization. King Charles III of Spain and his successors sent a number of expeditions from New Spain to present-day Canada and Alaska between 1774 and 1793, to counter the threat of Russian and British colonizers and to strengthen the Spanish claim. During this period of history it was important for a nation's claims to be backed up by exploration and the "first European discovery" of particular places.

3. Title: Early knowledge of the Pacific Northwest. Fact: The Pacific Northwest coast of North America was one of the last coastlines reached by European explorers. In terms of sailing time from Europe, it was one of the most distant places on earth. This article covers what Europeans knew or thought they knew before the area was explored by Captain Cook in 1778.

4. Title: Russian exploration of the Pacific Northwest. Fact: The Russian Empire began its interest of the Pacific Northwest in the 18th century, initially curious if there was a land connection between the Eurasian and North American Continents. Two expeditions were led by Vitus Bering, with the findings proving the separation of two continents through the Bering Sea. Being the first European nation to chart much of what comprises the modern American state of Alaska, many locations retain Russian place names. The discovery of sizable fur bearing populations by Bering drew the attention of promyshlenniki previously engaged in the Siberian fur trade. Based out of the Siberian ports of Okhotsk or Petropavlovsk, fur trappers sailed and reported the location of land formations like the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island and portions of the Alaskan mainland. Relations with Native Alaskans was often terse due to the uncontrolled actions of particular promyshlenniki who killed and raped Indigenous on islands they trapped furs.

5. Title: Discovery of North-West Passage Act 1744. Fact: The Discovery of North-West Passage Act 1744 (18 Geo. II, c.17) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Great Britain passed in 1745 and repealed in 1818. It offered a public reward for the successful discovery of a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

Question: is point guard and shooting guard the same thing
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Shooting guard. Fact: "The Basketball Handbook" by Lee Rose describes a shooting guard as someone whose primary role is to score points. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are good long-range shooters, typically averaging 35–40 percent from three-point range. Many shooting guards are also strong and athletic, and have the ability to get inside the paint and drive to the basket.

2. Title: Point guard. Fact: The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in soccer (association football). They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game.

3. Title: Basketball positions. Fact: Typically, the point guard is the leader of the team when on the court. This position requires substantial ball handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play. The shooting guard, as the name implies, is often the best shooter and is probably capable of shooting accurately from longer distances. Generally, they also have good ball-handling skills. The small forward often has an aggressive approach to the basket when handling the ball. The power forward and the center are usually called "low post" players to the basket, often acting as their team's primary rebounders or shot blockers, or receiving passes to take inside shots. The center is typically the larger of the two.

4. Title: Basketball. Fact: Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket in diameter mounted high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

5. Title: Center (basketball). Fact: Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency. In the 1950s and 1960s, George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979–80 season, however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished. A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as stretch five.

Question: who brings the ball up the court in basketball
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Basketball. Fact: Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.

2. Title: Jump shot (basketball). Fact: In basketball (and derivatives like netball), a player may attempt to score a basket by leaping straight into the air, the elbow of the shooting hand cocked, ball in hand above the head, and lancing the ball in a high arc towards the basket for a jump shot (colloquially, a jumper). Although early critics thought the leap might lead to indecision in the air, the jump shot replaced the earlier, less quickly released "set shot", and eventually transformed the game because it is the easiest shot to make from a distance and more difficult for a defender to block. Variations on the simple jump shot include the "turnaround jumper" (facing away from the basket, then jumping and spinning towards it, shooting the ball in mid-air); the "fadeaway" (jumping "away" from the basket to create space); and the "leaning jumper" (jumping towards the basket to move away from a trailing defender). With the "hook shot," a player is turned sideways with the shooting arm away from the basket outstretched so that with a sweep he can launch the ball over his head. Since a defender must leap to block a jumper, the shooter may use a pump fake to get the defender in the air at the wrong time and so have a clear shot. If the shooter leaps into the defender, a foul is called on the defensive player, whereat the shooter is awarded two or three free throws according to the value of a missed attempt, or a single free throw if he scores.

3. Title: Alley-oop (basketball). Fact: An alley-oop in basketball is an offensive play in which one player throws the ball near the basket to a teammate who jumps, catches the ball in mid air and slam dunks it before touching the ground.

4. Title: Basketball court. Fact: The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

5. Title: Point forward. Fact: Generally teams employ a point forward when their best playmaker is a forward rather than a guard. A point forward is typically responsible for bringing the ball up the court and being the primary facilitator on offense, but may merely direct play once a guard brings the ball up-court.

That year, the IRA found intelligence documents belonging to the British Auxiliary Division in Dunmanway, which apparently confirmed the existence of the group, and included a list of names of informers. This resulted in many informers being granted safe passage and protection in England by the British government. During the conflict, the local IRA brigade executed 15 informers, six of whom were Protestants. In April 1922, after a truce had come into effect, IRA members shot dead 13 Protestants in the Dunmanway area. It was claimed they were members of the Action Group, but this is disputed.

Question: does your next of kin have to be over 18
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Next of kin. Fact: In some legal systems, rights regarding inheritance (which imply a decision-making capacity - for example, in a medical emergency - where no clear will or instructions have been given, and where the person has no spouse) flow to the closest relative (regardless of the age, with a representative appointed if a minor), usually a child, a parent or a sibling. However, there are people without any close adult relatives and, in such a case, decision-making power often flows to a niece or nephew, first cousin, aunt or uncle, or grandparent.

2. Title: Kinkaid Act. Fact: The legal provisions of the Kinkaid Act were very similar to those of the Homestead Act. A claimant had to be at least 21 years of age (or 18 if the head of a household), and a current U.S. citizen or in the process of becoming a citizen. Five years of residency was required to gain title to a claim, with exceptions made to account for years of military service. In 1912 the residency requirement was shortened to three years, in order to attract more settlers. A claimant also had to prove that improvements equivalent to $1.25 per acre had been made to the property.

3. Title: 18 (number). Fact: In most countries, 18 is the age of majority (adulthood) and also the voting age.

4. Title: Age of candidacy laws in the United States. Fact: N.A. implies that such a position does not exist in that state.

5. Title: Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fact: The Twenty-sixth Amendment (Amendment XXVI) to the United States Constitution prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States who are at least eighteen years old. It was proposed by Congress on March 23, 1971, and ratified on July 1, 1971, the quickest ratification of an amendment in history.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Adventures of Tintin (film). Fact: Spielberg acquired rights to produce a film based on The Adventures of Tintin series following Hergé's death in 1983, and re-optioned them in 2002. Filming was due to begin in October 2008 for a 2010 release, but release was delayed to 2011 after Universal opted out of producing the film with Paramount, who provided $30 million on pre-production. Sony chose to co-produce the film. The delay resulted in Thomas Sangster, who had been originally cast as Tintin, departing from the project. Producer Peter Jackson, whose company Weta Digital provided the computer animation, intends to direct a sequel. Spielberg and Jackson also hope to co-direct a third film. The world première took place on 22 October 2011 in Brussels.

4. Title: Count Duckula 2. Fact: It was the follow-up to the 1989 release "Count Duckula in No Sax Please—We're Egyptian". Both are tie-in licenses of the Cosgrove Hall "Count Duckula" cartoon series.

Question: where does boromir die in lord of the rings
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Boromir. Fact: During the scattered fighting against orcs near Parth Galen, Boromir was mortally wounded by arrows while defending Merry and Pippin, redeeming himself for trying to take the Ring. The fighting is described through Pippin's eyes:

2. Title: Flint Fireforge. Fact: Flint dies in the third book of the "Chronicles" series. Paladine, in the guise of Fizban, takes him to Reorx's forge, where he waits for Tasslehoff's passing.

3. Title: Robin Hood's Death. Fact: In the fragmentary Percy Folio version Robin Hood goes to get himself bled (a common medieval medical practice) by his cousin, a prioress. He refuses a bodyguard that Will Scarlet offers and takes only Little John with him. The prioress treacherously lets out too much blood, killing him, or her lover Sir Roger of Doncaster stabs him while he's weak, in revenge for Robin's family having inherited his land and title. Robin Hood claims some consolation, though, in that he mortally wounds Roger prior to his own demise. Little John wishes to avenge him, but Robin forbids it, because he has never harmed a woman.

4. Title: Mr. Fairlie's Final Journey. Fact: The book concerns the investigation into the death of Jonas Fairlie, who was murdered on a train while on his way to consult Solar Pons. To solve the mystery, Pons and his companion, Dr. Lyndon Parker, travel to Fairlie's home town of Frome, Somerset and from there to Scotland (Pons only), Cheltenham in Gloucestershire and finally to a remote area on the coast of Wales.

5. Title: Robin Hood and the Valiant Knight. Fact: The king and nobles meet to consider Robin Hood. They send Sir William with a hundred men. Sir William presents him with a letter from the king ordering Robin to surrender. When Robin refuses, Sir William attempts to seize him on the spot. Both Sir William and Robin summon their men, and they fight. After the battle, Robin takes ill. A monk lets his blood (a common medical procedure at the time), and Robin dies. His men all flee.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Country Strong. Fact: Country Strong (originally titled Love Don't Let Me Down) is a 2010 drama film starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Tim McGraw, Garrett Hedlund, and Leighton Meester. The film, about an emotionally unstable country music star who attempts to resurrect her career, was directed and written by American filmmaker Shana Feste. It premiered in Nashville, Tennessee on November 8, 2010, and had a wide release in the United States on January 7, 2011. This is the second film in which McGraw and Hedlund have worked together, the first being Friday Night Lights in 2004.

2. Title: Country Strong (song). Fact: The song was released to country music radio on August 23, 2010, and has reached the Top 30 of the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart. It has also been made into a music video, featuring scenes from the film.

3. Title: Country Strong (soundtrack). Fact: Country Strong is a soundtrack album for the film of the same name. It was released by RCA Nashville on October 26, 2010. It is preceded by two singles: the title track, performed by the film's star Gwyneth Paltrow, which was released on July 26, 2010, and "A Little Bit Stronger", performed by Sara Evans and released on September 27, 2010. In addition to Paltrow, the film's co-stars Garrett Hedlund, Tim McGraw and Leighton Meester all sing on the soundtrack, which also features country music stars Lee Ann Womack, Hank Williams Jr., and Faith Hill, among others.

If Paltrow never quite sounds convincing as a country singer -- she seems just a little too mannered to be 'Country Strong' -- "Gossip Girl" Leighton Meester pulls off the sweet 'Words I Couldn’t Say' with ease, and the rest of the soundtrack is handed over to professionals".

5. Title: Country Strong (song). Fact: "Country Strong" is a song written by Jennifer Hanson, Tony Martin and Mark Nesler. It was recorded by singer Britni Hoover in 2007 for her debut album under the same name. Then it was recorded again by actress Gwyneth Paltrow for the movie "Country Strong" in which Paltrow stars.

Question: what team was case keenum on before the vikings
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Case Keenum. Fact: After being signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2012, Keenum threw for 1,760 yards and 9 touchdowns in the eight games he started for the Texans, before being waived prior to the 2014 season. Keenum was then signed to the St. Louis Rams' practice squad. He re-signed with the Texans later in 2014. In 2015, the Rams traded a draft pick to the Texans for Keenum, where he played until signing as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. After starter Sam Bradford got injured, Keenum came in and had a career year, setting highs in starts, passing yards, completions and touchdowns. He led the Vikings to a 13-win regular season, followed by a last-second win over the New Orleans Saints in the divisional round of the playoffs; the Vikings lost in the next round to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Keenum once again became a free agent, and signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in March 2018.

2. Title: Grady Alderman. Fact: Grady Alderman (December 10, 1938 – April 5, 2018) was an American football player and executive. He played professionally as an offensive tackle for 16 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), mostly with the Minnesota Vikings.

3. Title: John Ward (American football). Fact: John Henry Ward (May 27, 1948 – December 4, 2012) was a National Football League lineman who played from 1970 to 1976 for the Minnesota Vikings, the Chicago Bears and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played high school football at Will Rogers High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and college football for the Oklahoma State Cowboys and was the Vikings' first round pick in the 1970 NFL Draft.

4. Title: Curt Marsh. Fact: Curt Marsh (born August 25, 1959) is a former American football offensive tackle. He was selected in the first round by the Oakland Raiders out of the University of Washington in the 1981 NFL Draft. Marsh was a High School All-American at Snohomish High School in Snohomish, Washington. Marsh played for the Raiders through 1987. He underwent more than 20 surgeries for football-related injuries, including a foot amputation, which he attributes to inadequate medical care.

5. Title: Ken Gray (American football). Fact: Kenneth Don Gray (March 10, 1936 – November 25, 2017) was an offensive guard who played 13 seasons in the National Football League for the Chicago Cardinals/St. Louis Cardinals and the Houston Oilers. Born in San Saba, Texas, Gray attended and played football for four seasons at Howard Payne University. His first NFL contract, in 1958, paid him $6,000. In those days the league was composed of 12 teams, split into two divisions. After retiring as a player, earning six All-Pro awards, he served for three years as head coach at his high school alma mater, Llano High and offensive line coach for the 1977 AFC Champion Denver Bronco team that earned its way to Super Bowl XII, to play against the Dallas Cowboys. In 2016, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame along with former University of Texas head football coach Fred Akers, former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Larry Allen and former Major League Baseball pitcher Andy Pettitte. He earned a spot on the St. Louis Cardinals’ All-Time Team and the NFL All-1960s Team. A Christian, Gray first and foremost considered himself blessed with his lovely and gracious wife, Shirley, who has stood by him through all the years of risking injury in high school, college and league play, and the unique challenges of his coaching years to the present. They met and were wed back in their high school days at Llano High School. Their union produced two sons, Shane and Boyd and a grandson, Garret.

Question:  George Alfred Maran attended Harvard University where he and his voice came to the attention of a prolific German composer whose most popular work was written in what year?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: George Maran. Fact: George Alfred Maran (July 25, 1926 – Nov 26, 2011) was an American opera, oratorio, and concert tenor.  Born near Boston, Massachusetts. Maran attended Harvard University where he and his voice came to the attention of people such as Leonard Bernstein and Paul Hindemith. He first drew international attention when he won the “Mozart-Medaille”(Mozart Medal) from the Mozarteum International Foundation in Salzburg in 1956 on Mozart’s 200th birthday. The same year, and the next forty years thereafter, he was a soloist at the Opera in Darmstadt, Germany. Even so, he continued singing all over Europe and the United States, the world premiere of A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera) with Benjamin Britten conducting as a prime example. He has sung many wide-ranging and varied genres as soloist in opera, operetta, oratorio, and on the concert stage.

2. Title: Paul Hindemith. Fact: Paul Hindemith (English:  /ˌˈhɪndəmɪt/) (16 November 1895 – 28 December 1963) was a prolific German composer, violist, violinist, teacher and conductor. Notable compositions include his song cycle Das Marienleben (1923), Der Schwanendreher for viola and orchestra (1935), and opera Mathis der Maler (1938). Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is likely the Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber, written in 1943.

3. Title: Anton Bruckner. Fact: Josef Anton Bruckner (; ) was an Austrian composer, organist, and music theorist best known for his symphonies, masses, Te Deum and motets. The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies.

4. Title: Maurice Schlesinger. Fact: Moritz Adolf Schlesinger (30 October 1798 in Berlin - 25 February 1871 in Baden-Baden), generally known during his French career as Maurice Schlesinger, was a German music editor. He is perhaps best remembered for inspiring the character of M. Arnoux in Gustave Flaubert's novel "Sentimental Education".

5. Title: Heinrich Köselitz. Fact: Johann Heinrich Köselitz (10 January 1854 – 15 August 1918) was a German author and composer. He is known for his longtime friendship with Friedrich Nietzsche, who gave him the pseudonym Peter Gast.

Question: The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Bucks' 32nd season in the National Basketball Association, Ray Allen and who, were both selected for the 2000 NBA All-Star Game?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 1999–2000 Milwaukee Bucks season. Fact: The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Bucks' 32nd season in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Bucks acquired Danny Manning and re-acquired Dale Ellis from the Orlando Magic. With Sam Cassell playing a full season after missing most of the lockout season due to injury, the Bucks played above .500 in the first half of the season. However, they struggled in February posting a 3–9 record as Ellis was traded to the Charlotte Hornets. With less than a month to go, the Bucks playoff chances appeared bleak as they had a 32–37 record in late March. However, down the stretch, they won 10 of their final 13 games to sneak into the playoffs as the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference, finishing fifth in the Central Division with a 42–40 record. Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson were both selected for the 2000 NBA All-Star Game.

2. Title: Ray Allen. Fact: Walter Ray Allen Jr. (born July 20, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing three seasons of college basketball for Connecticut, Allen entered the NBA in 1996 and went on to play for the Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle SuperSonics, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. One of the most accurate three-point and free throw shooters in NBA history, he was a ten-time NBA All-Star, and won two NBA championships (2008, 2013) with the Celtics and Heat respectively. He also won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 2000 United States men's basketball team. Allen is the NBA's all-time leader in career three-point field goals made in both the regular and postseason. He has acted in two films, one of which was a lead role in the 1998 Spike Lee film, He Got Game.

3. Title: 2000–01 Milwaukee Bucks season. Fact: In the first round of the playoffs, led by the trio of Allen, Robinson and Sam Cassell, the Bucks defeated the Orlando Magic in four games. It was the first time the Bucks made it out of the NBA playoffs' first round since 1988–89. Then, in the semifinals, they would defeat the 6th-seeded Charlotte Hornets in seven games after trailing 3–2. However, they would lose in seven games in the conference finals to regular season MVP Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers. Following the season, Hunter was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, Scott Williams was dealt to the Denver Nuggets and Kersey retired.

4. Title: 2000 NBA All-Star Game. Fact: The Western Conference won the game with the score of 137-126 while Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan were both named MVP of the game. O'Neal took the All Star MVP trophy saying to Duncan, "you already have one of those rings (referring to the championship ring Duncan received due to him being a member of the 1998-99 Championship team with David Robinson and Gregg Popovich), so I'm taking the trophy." Allen Iverson was the leading scorer of the game with 26 points.

5. Title: 2000–01 Los Angeles Lakers season. Fact: The 2000–01 NBA season was the Lakers' 53rd season in the National Basketball Association, and 41st in the city of Los Angeles. The Lakers entered the season as the defending NBA champions, having defeated the Indiana Pacers in the 2000 NBA Finals in six games, winning their twelfth NBA championship. During the offseason, the Lakers acquired Horace Grant from the Seattle SuperSonics. Grant won three championships with the Chicago Bulls in the early 1990s. The team also signed free agent Isaiah Rider, who was released by the Atlanta Hawks the previous season due to off the court troubles. The Lakers won their final eight games finishing the regular season with a 56–26 record, and won the Pacific Division over the rival Sacramento Kings by one game. Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal were both selected for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, but O'Neal did not play due to an injury. The Lakers clinched the #2 seed in the playoffs.

Question: John Marshall was the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and served as Secretary of State under what American patriot who served as the second President of the United States?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: John Marshall. Fact: John Marshall (September 24, 1755 – July 6, 1835) was an American politician. He was the fourth Chief Justice of the United States (1801–1835). His court opinions helped lay the basis for United States constitutional law and many[who?] say he made the Supreme Court of the United States a coequal branch of government along with the legislative and executive branches. Previously, Marshall had been a leader of the Federalist Party in Virginia and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1799 to 1800. He was Secretary of State under President John Adams from 1800 to 1801 and, at the age of 45, became the last of the chief justices to be born in Colonial America.

2. Title: John Adams. Fact: John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (1797–1801) and the first Vice President (1789–97). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.

3. Title: Dean Acheson. Fact: Dean Gooderham Acheson (pronounced ; April 11, 1893 – October 12, 1971) was an American statesman and lawyer. As United States Secretary of State in the administration of President Harry S. Truman from 1949 to 1953, he played a central role in defining American foreign policy during the Cold War. Acheson helped design the Marshall Plan and was a key player in the development of the Truman Doctrine and creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

4. Title: Levi Lincoln Sr.. Fact: Levi Lincoln Sr. (May 15, 1749 – April 14, 1820) was an American revolutionary, lawyer, and statesman from Massachusetts. A Democratic-Republican, he most notably served as Thomas Jefferson's first Attorney General, and played a significant role in the events that led to the celebrated "Marbury v. Madison" court case. He served two terms as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, acting as Governor for the remainder of Governor James Sullivan's term after his death in December 1808. Lincoln was unsuccessful in his bid to be elected governor in his own right in 1809.

5. Title: Richard Olney. Fact: Richard Olney (September 15, 1835 – April 8, 1917) was an American statesman. He served as United States Attorney General and Secretary of State under President Grover Cleveland, and in the latter position, briefly, under Cleveland's successor, William McKinley. As attorney general, Olney used injunctions against striking workers in the Pullman strike, setting a precedent, and advised the use of federal troops, when legal means failed to control the strikers. As secretary of state, he raised the status of America in the world by elevating U.S. diplomatic posts to the status of embassy.

Question: What is the publishing date of this novel by Ruth Plumly Thompson, originally written in 1959, and featuring Jinnicky the Red Jinn as a principal pre-existing character?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jinnicky the Red Jinn. Fact: The Red Jinn, later known as Jinnicky, is one of Ruth Plumly Thompson's most frequently occurring characters in her Oz books.  He was first introduced in Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz as a mysterious figure who educates Jack Pumpkinhead on the use of the Pirate Sack.  Although a detailed description is included in the text, Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz includes no illustrations of the Red Jinn aside from a gruesome color plate that did not appear outside the first edition, in which he has massive piercings.  He was reintroduced, drawn, and given the name Jinnicky in The Purple Prince of Oz; he also appeared in the follow-up, The Silver Princess in Oz.  (He makes a cameo appearance in The Wishing Horse of Oz, and he is the principal pre-existing character in Thompson's sub-canonical penultimate Oz book, Yankee in Oz).   Jack Snow apparently thought the Red Jinn was a separate character, for he considered The Purple Prince of Oz Jinnicky's first appearance in Who's Who in Oz, though he did not include a separate Red Jinn entry.

2. Title: The Golem and the Jinni. Fact: The Golem and the Jinni (known as The Golem and the Djinni in the United Kingdom) is a debut novel written by Helene Wecker, published by Harper in April 2013. It combines the genre of historical fiction with elements of fantasy, telling the story of two displaced magical creatures in 19th century New York City.

3. Title: Wenjack (novella). Fact: Wenjack is a historical fiction novella based on the story of Chanie "Charlie" Wenjack by Canadian author Joseph Boyden. It was published by Hamish Hamilton of Penguin Books in 2016 and features illustrations by Cree artist Kent Monkman. It was part of a collaborative effort to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Chanie's death. The book follows Chanie Wenjack, a 12-year-old Ojibwe boy, as he escapes from a Northern Ontario residential school in the futile hopes of returning home to his family and two dogs. It alternates between Chanie's perspective and the perspectives of Manitous, who take on different animal forms to keep a silent watch on Chanie as he walks on foot to a home he does not know is hundreds of kilometers away.

4. Title: Yankee in Oz. Fact: Yankee in Oz is a 1972 Oz novel by Ruth Plumly Thompson.  It was the first published by The International Wizard of Oz Club.  A letter from the Henry Regnery Company, which bought Reilly & Lee, is reproduced in the front indicating the publisher's blessing for the new Oz book to appear.  It was originally written in 1959, but because the Oz books were not selling, it was not published.  The first two editions of the book were published in 8½ x 11 inch format and running only 94 pages.  This was done at the request of illustrator Dick Martin to reduce the number of required illustrations and to show them closer to the actual size they were drawn.  The second printing (1986) featured a new cover, with the first edition artwork reprinted preceding the title page.  The third printing (2007) is standard Oz book size.  Its cover is a gaudier redesign of the second edition cover.  The book also features maps by James E. Haff, and as such, Thompson correctly places the Winkie Country in the west of Oz.

5. Title: The Adventure of the Red Widow. Fact: The Adventure of the Red Widow is a short Sherlock Holmes murder mystery by Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator. The story was published in the 1954 collection, "The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes".

Question: what kind of animal is eileen from regular show
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of Regular Show characters. Fact: Rigby (voiced by William Salyers) is a 3'5" anthropomorphic brown raccoon who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. He has been best friends with Mordecai since childhood and slacks off even more than Mordecai does. Rigby is hyperactive, immature, and extremely mischievous, which sometimes puts him at odds with Mordecai. He mostly lives for simply having a good time and relaxing, which he sometimes achieves through selfish acts like lying or cheating. He has a bad habit of getting himself and others in trouble, often causing many of the chaotic and surreal problems that arise in The Park. Nevertheless, he is shown to be a good person deep down and sticks closely to his friends. Like Mordecai, Rigby loves to play video games, but he is the worse of the two. He is also shown to be the weakest of The Park workers, although he has surprised them on a few occasions. Rigby's lack of strength was a major plot point in the episode "One Pull Up," in which Rigby had to pass a company physical and keep his job by performing one pull up. He has a younger brother named "Don", whose height and physique lead people to believe that he, not Rigby, is the older brother. Eileen Roberts, a female mole who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret Smith, has strong feelings for Rigby and makes this very obvious. He originally did not reciprocate her feelings and harshly ignored her at some points, but he quickly begins to warm up to her and implies that he likes her, as well. In "Dumped at the Altar", Rigby reveals to Mordecai that he and Eileen have been dating for 3 months. Rigby is allergic to eggs, as evidenced in the episode "Eggscellent" when Rigby tried to eat a 12-egg omelet to win a trucker hat and went into a coma due to a severe allergic reaction. Rigby has also died four times and was resurrected in the series. He was killed by Skips in an arm wrestling match, he was killed by Snowballs the monster, he was killed by Mordecai who pushed him into the Space-Time Continuum, and fell into a fatal coma in "Eggscellent". As of Rigby's Graduation Day Special, Rigby has finally graduated from high school. In the epilogue to "A Regular Epic Final Battle", Rigby quits The Park and moves in with Eileen. They eventually get married and start a family, but it's unknown if Rigby is working or not as he is seen teaching his children how to play video games.

2. Title: Being Eileen. Fact: The series, written by Michael Wynne, features an ensemble cast. Headed by Sue Johnston, who plays Eileen Lewis, the programme focusses on her, the widowed matriarch of a "large, close-knit and dysfunctional Northern family". The single episode focused on the family's visit to Lapland, whilst the series focusses on their life in Birkenhead. Elizabeth Berrington and Stephen Graham (later recast to Dean Andrews) play Eileen's children, whilst William Ash and Julie Graham play their partners. All the cast - Johnston, Berrington, Ash, Julie Graham and Keith Barron- a love interest for Eileen - returned for the series, with the exception of Stephen Graham and Zawe Ashton, who played Jingle Jill.

3. Title: Regular Show. Fact: Regular Show (also known as Regular Show in Space during its eighth season) is an American animated television sitcom created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network that aired from September 6, 2010, to January 16, 2017. The series revolves around the lives of two working-class friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigbyboth employed as groundskeepers at a local park. They usually try to solve a simple problem that leads to a surreal, extreme, and often supernatural misadventure. During these misadventures, they interact with the show's other main characters: Benson, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost.

4. Title: List of Regular Show episodes. Fact: "Regular Show" is an American animated comedy television series created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network. It ran from September 6, 2010, to January 16, 2017, concluding with a total of 261 episodes through eight seasons. The series revolves around the lives of two friends who are 23 – a blue jay named Mordecai (Quintel) and a raccoon named Rigby (William Salyers) – both of whom are employed as groundskeepers at a local park. "Regular Show" depicts their daily routines at work and usual attempts to slack off, which often result in surreal misadventures. Other major characters include fellow groundskeepers Skips (Mark Hamill), Muscle Man (Sam Marin) and Hi-Five Ghost (Quintel), park manager Pops (Marin), and their boss Benson (Marin).

5. Title: Eileen Derbyshire. Fact: Eileen was born in Urmston, Lancashire and from the age of 17, was appearing in plays broadcast on the radio. After several small parts on television, she joined the cast of "Coronation Street", first appearing as Miss Nugent in episode 15 in January 1961 (the character appeared as an extra in episode 4 in December 1960 played by an uncredited walk-on actress). The character was then given the forename Emily in 1962.

Question: Where was the album of the American band Death Grips, that later peaked at number 130 on the "Billboard" 200 chart leaked on April 14, 2012?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Money Store (album). Fact: The Money Store is the debut studio album by the group Death Grips. It was officially released on April 24, 2012, but was leaked to YouTube on April 14 and made available on vinyl on April 21 to celebrate Record Store Day. It was announced along with a second album, which would be titled No Love Deep Web. It is the follow-up to their debut mixtape Exmilitary.

2. Title: Death Grips discography. Fact: American band Death Grips has released six studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, seven singles, eight promotional singles, three remixes, and 42 music videos. The band was formed by MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy "Flatlander" Morin in Sacramento during the winter of 2010. In March 2011, they released their eponymous debut EP. The mixtape Exmilitary followed a month later and was praised by contemporary music critics. Death Grips signed a record deal with Epic Records in early 2012 and their debut studio album The Money Store was released in April to critical acclaim, peaking at number 130 on the Billboard 200 chart. Because Epic Records would not confirm a release date for their second studio album No Love Deep Web before 2013, Death Grips self-released the album in November 2012. As a result of this and the ensuing conflict between the band and the record label, Death Grips was dropped by Epic Records. No Love Deep Web received positive reviews and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.

3. Title: A Death-Grip On Yesterday. Fact: It was leaked onto P2P and BitTorrent sites on February 24, over a month before its official release. A week after its release, it had sold more than 69,000 copies and started out at #9 on the "Billboard" 200. It has gone on to sell more than 340,000 copies.

4. Title: Weapon (album). Fact: Weapon is the twelfth studio album by Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy. It was released on May 28, 2013 through Metropolis Records. Skinny Puppy received mainstream media attention when the band billed the U.S. government for using its music as torture in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, which was a primary source of inspiration for the album. Musically, "Weapon's" sound is reminiscent of Skinny Puppy's earliest releases, "Remission" (1984) and "Bites" (1985), due to the employment of old equipment and simplified songwriting.

5. Title: The Terror (album). Fact: The Terror is the thirteenth studio album by experimental rock band the Flaming Lips, released on April 1, 2013 worldwide and April 16 in the U.S., on Warner Bros in the U.S. and Bella Union in the U.K. It is the last album to feature drummer Kliph Scurlock who was fired from the band a year after this album's release. It is also the first album for band member Derek Brown. Lead vocalist Wayne Coyne described the album's general idea in a press release:"We want, or wanted, to believe that without love we would disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, if we have love, give love and know love, we are truly alive and if there is no love, there would be no life. The Terror is, we know now, that even without love, life goes on... we just go on… there is no mercy killing." Experimental composer Dan Deacon remixed the album in its entirety.

Question: when did the soviet union developed its first atomic bomb
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Soviet atomic bomb project. Fact: On 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first successful weapon test (First Lightning), based on the U.S. design at the Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.

2. Title: RDS-37. Fact: RDS-37 was the Soviet Union's first two-stage hydrogen bomb, first tested on 22 November 1955. The weapon had a nominal yield of approximately 3 megatons. It was scaled down to 1.6 megatons for the live test.

3. Title: 1978 Soviet nuclear tests. Fact: According to an article that appeared in 2010 on the Russia state broadcaster RT, on November 17, 1978, the USSR detonated its first neutron bomb. However this test detonation, if it indeed occurred on the date given, has no other known references to support this date.

4. Title: History of nuclear weapons. Fact: Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive power from nuclear fission or combined fission and fusion reactions. Building on scientific breakthroughs made during the 1930s, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada collaborated during World War II, in what was called the Manhattan Project, to counter the suspected Nazi German atomic bomb project. In August 1945, two fission bombs were dropped on Japan, standing to date as the only use of nuclear weapons in combat. The Soviet Union started development shortly thereafter with their own atomic bomb project, and not long after that both countries developed even more powerful fusion weapons known as "hydrogen bombs".

5. Title: Nuclear weapons testing. Fact: The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. The first thermonuclear weapon technology test of an engineered device, codenamed "Ivy Mike", was tested at the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, 1952 (local date), also by the United States. The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the "Tsar Bomba" of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50–58 megatons.

Question: is money from jersey legal tender in uk
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jersey pound. Fact: Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.

2. Title: Virgin Money UK. Fact: Virgin Money (UK) is a banking and financial services brand operating in the United Kingdom as a trading name used by Virgin Money UK PLC.

3. Title: United Kingdom and the euro. Fact: The United Kingdom has never sought to adopt the euro as its official currency for the duration of its membership of the European Union (EU), and secured an opt-out at the euro's creation via the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. Polls have shown that the majority of British people have been against adopting the euro, and in a June 2016 referendum the UK voted to withdraw from the EU which would virtually eliminate the chance of any future adoption. Despite never being a member of the eurozone, the currency is used in the UK's Cypriot territories and as a secondary currency in Gibraltar; furthermore, London is home to the majority of the euro's clearing houses.

4. Title: Clydesdale Bank plc. Fact: As with two other Scottish banks, the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank retains the right to issue its own banknotes.

5. Title: Loans to Ireland Act 2010. Fact: The Loans to Ireland Act 2010 (c. 41) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The final disbursement of the loan was made on 26 September 2013. The final repayment by Ireland is due on 26 March 2021.

Question: The Bronx Zoo is a memoir of Lyle's tenure with which American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Bronx Zoo (book). Fact: The Bronx Zoo: The Astonishing Inside Story of the 1978 World Champion New York Yankees is a nonfiction book written by former Major League Baseball pitcher Sparky Lyle and Peter Golenbock. A memoir of Lyle's tenure with the New York Yankees, the book documents the 1978 New York Yankees season, including the 1978 World Series and conflicts between players. The book was published by Crown Publishers in 1979.

2. Title: New York Yankees. Fact: The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the New York Mets of the National League. In the 1901 season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise (which had ceased operations) and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders. The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in 1913.

3. Title: The Bronx Zoo (TV series). Fact: Benjamin Harris High School is set in the impoverished, unruly inner-city Bronx. Principal Joe Danzig (Edward Asner) does his best to maintain optimism, while dealing with the lack of motivation and direction of his staff.

4. Title: The Bronx Bull. Fact: A combination prequel and sequel of the "Raging Bull" that explores "before the rage" and "after the rage" of world middleweight boxing champ Jake LaMotta's tumultuous life and times.

5. Title: Baseball Fever. Fact: The book is located primarily in Flushing, New York, although the story includes Princeton, New Jersey and other locations. It also depicts the numerous attempts of the protagonist to get his scholarly father interested in baseball, much to his dismay.

Question: major league baseball teams with the most world series wins
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: World Series. Fact: In the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series. In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals have appeared in 19 and won 11, the New York/San Francisco Giants have played in 20 and won 8, the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in 19 and won 6, and the Cincinnati Reds have appeared in 9 and won 5.

2. Title: List of World Series champions. Fact: The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the "Fall Classic", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.

3. Title: List of American League pennant winners. Fact: Each Major League Baseball (MLB) season, one American League (AL) team wins the pennant, signifying that they are the league's champion and have the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League (NL). The pennant was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each year through the 1968 season, after which the AL Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the pennant winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current AL pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2019.

4. Title: List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts. Fact: All 16 of the original Major League franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for a franchise's first championship being for the Phillies ( years, ending in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, six of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series. Further, one franchise (the Indians) has a current championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox ( years, ending in 2004), the White Sox ( years, ending in 2005), and the Cubs ( years, ending in 2016).

5. Title: List of pre-World Series baseball champions. Fact: The modern World Series, the current championship series of Major League Baseball, began in 1903, and was established as an annual event in 1905. Before the formation of the American Association (AA), there were no playoff rounds—all championships went to the team with the best record at the end of the season. In the initial season of the National League (NL) in 1876, there was controversy as to which team was the champion: the Chicago White Stockings, who had the best overall record (52–14), or the St. Louis Brown Stockings (45–19), who were the only team to have a winning record against every other franchise in the league. The teams agreed to play a five-game "Championship of the West" series, won by St. Louis, 4 games to 1. Beginning in 1884, the championship series between the National League and the American Association were promoted and referred to as the "World's Championship Series" (WCS), or "World's Series" for short; however, they are not officially recognized by Major League Baseball as part of World Series history. Though early publications, such as Ernest Lanigan's "Baseball Cyclopedia" and Turkin and Thompson's "Encyclopedia of Baseball", listed the 19th-century games on an equal basis with those of the 20th century, "Sporting News" publications about the World Series, which began in the 1920s, ignored the 19th-century games, as did most publications about the Series after 1960. Major League Baseball, in general, regards 19th-century events as a prologue to the modern era of baseball, which is defined by the emergence of the two present major leagues.

Question: name of the horse in steptoe and son
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Steptoe and Son. Fact: The series' title music, "Old Ned", won its composer Ron Grainer his second successive Ivor Novello award. The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoe's horse, Hercules. "Steptoe and Son" is the Steptoes' trading name, but as established in the first episode, the "Son" is not Harold as initially believed, but Albert. The name dates from when he and his mother—Mrs. Steptoe—worked the rounds. The first series has the pair as very rough looking and often dirty and wearing ragged clothes, but they quickly "tidied up" for later series.

2. Title: Steptoe and Son (film). Fact: Steptoe and Son is a 1972 British comedy drama film and a spin-off from the popular British television comedy series of the same name about father-and-son rag-and-bone dealers. It starred Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett as the eponymous characters, Albert and Harold Steptoe respectively. It also features Carolyn Seymour. A sequel, "Steptoe and Son Ride Again", was released the following year.

3. Title: The Seven Foals. Fact: The hero of the story is sometimes called, in an analogue to "Cinderella", Cinder-lad.

4. Title: Swoon's Son. Fact: Swoon's Son (1953–1977) is an American Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse. Foaled February 13, 1953 in Lexington, Kentucky, he was bred and raced by E. Gay Drake, owner of Lexington's Mineola Stock Farm and a charter member of the Thoroughbred Club of America.

5. Title: The New One (horse). Fact: The New One is a bay gelding with a white star bred in Ireland by R. Brown and the Ballylinch Stud. He is one of many successful National Hunt horses sired by the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner King's Theatre. He is the first foal of his dam Thuringe, a poor racehorse who failed to win in ten races in France and was retired after being pulled up in her only attempt over hurdles in England.

Question: when did the metric system start in canada
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Metrication in Canada. Fact: Metrication in Canada began in 1970 and while Canada has converted to the metric system for many purposes, there is still significant use of non-metric units and standards in many sectors of the Canadian economy. This is mainly due to historical ties with the United Kingdom (before metrication), the traditional use of the imperial system of measurement in Canada, proximity to the United States, and to public opposition to metrication during the transition period.

2. Title: Metric Commission. Fact: The Metric Commission , formally the Preparatory Commission for the Conversion to the Metric System, was a Canadian government agency established by the federal government in 1971 to facilitate Canada's conversion to the Metric system from the imperial system of weights and measures and to educate the public on the Metric system.

3. Title: Metric system. Fact: The first nation to adopt the metric system (a process called metrication) was France, in the 1790s. In subsequent decades and centuries, most other nations adopted it in part or in full, with notable holdouts being Liberia, Myanmar, and the United States (which primarily uses U.S. customary units).

4. Title: Canada (unit). Fact: In the Portuguese metric system officially adopted in August 1814, "canada" was the name given to the unit of liquid volume. This metric canada was equivalent to 1 litre.

5. Title: Track gauge in Canada. Fact: The first railway in British North America, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, was built in the mid-1830s to track gauge. This was followed by the Albion Colliery tramway in and the Montreal and Lachine Railroad in . However the promoters of St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad, (intended to connect Montreal to the ice-free port at Portland, Maine) decided to use , setting a precedent for the colony for several decades. The first section from Longueuil to St. Hyacinthe opened in 1847 and at the end of that year there were of broad gauge and of standard gauge in Canada.

Question: what does the white colour in the nigeria flag stand for
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flag of Nigeria. Fact: The Flag of Nigeria was designed in 1959 and first officially hoisted on 1 October 1960. The flag is a vertical 1:2 triband of green, white, green. The two green stripes represent Nigeria's natural wealth, while the white band represents peace.

2. Title: Flag of Nigeria (1914–1960). Fact: The Flag of Nigeria between 1914 and 1960 was a British blue ensign with a green Star of David surrounding a Tudor Crown (later changed to a St Edward's Crown in 1953) with the white word "Nigeria" under it on a red disc. It was adopted by the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria following the amalgamation of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate.

3. Title: Coat of arms of Nigeria. Fact: The coat of arms of Nigeria consists of a black shield with a wavy white pall, symbolizing the meeting of the Niger and Benue Rivers at Lokoja. The black shield represents Nigeria's fertile soil, while the two supporting horses or chargers on each side represent dignity. The eagle represents strength, while the green and white bands on the top of the shield represent the rich soil.

4. Title: Flag of Cameroon. Fact: The colour scheme uses the traditional Pan-African colours (Cameroon was the second state to adopt them). The centre stripe is thought to stand for unity: red is the colour of unity, and the star is referred to as "the star of unity". The yellow stands for the sun, and also the savannas in the northern part of the country, while the green is for the forests in the southern part of Cameroon.

5. Title: Flag of Nigeria (1914–1960). Fact: The colonial flag of Nigeria was adopted in 1914 following the amalgamation of Southern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria. It was first suggested by the first Governor-General of Nigeria, Sir Frederick Lugard as a symbol of the unification of Nigeria and because of the Seal of Solomon which was associated with the native Igbo Jews. The Star of David had already been in use in Nigeria during the British rule because of the Igbo Jews who were featured on coins of the British West African pound. This was confirmed in the 1917 discovery of a bronze Star of David attributed to the Igbo Jews in Aguleri. The crest on the flag was also used on the flag of the Governor-General of Nigeria.

Question: did catherine zeta jones won an oscar for chicago
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Catherine Zeta-Jones. Fact: Zeta-Jones established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) and the heist film "Entrapment" (1999). She received acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in "Traffic" (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical "Chicago" (2002); for the latter she won Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actress. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy "Intolerable Cruelty" (2003), the heist film "Ocean's Twelve" (2004), the comedy "The Terminal" (2004), and the romantic comedy "No Reservations" (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to stage and played an ageing actress in "A Little Night Music" (2009), winning a Tony Award. Zeta-Jones continued to work intermittently in the 2010s, starring in the psychological thriller "Side Effects" (2013) and the action film "Red 2" (2013), and portrayed actress Olivia de Havilland in the FX television series "Feud" (2017).

2. Title: List of roles and awards of Catherine Zeta-Jones. Fact: The French-Italian fantasy feature 1001 Nights (1990) marked Zeta-Jones' film debut. She gained popularity in Britain with the role of a country girl in the television series The Darling Buds of May (1991-93)-the most watched series in the country at that time. However, disillusioned at only being offered roles of the love interest, Zeta-Jones shifted base to Los Angeles. She achieved early success by playing roles that relied significantly on her sex appeal, in the action film The Mask of Zorro (1998) and the caper thriller Entrapment (1999). The former earned her a Saturn Award for Best Actress nomination. Zeta-Jones' portrayal of a drug lord's wife in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic (2000) gained her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. She then won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago (2002). As the highest-paid British actresses in Hollywood at the time, she took on the parts of a serial divorcée in Intolerable Cruelty (2003), a flight attendant in The Terminal (2004) and a Europol agent in Ocean's Twelve (2004). A sequel to The Mask of Zorro, entitled The Legend of Zorro (2005), was a failure, following which Zeta-Jones played an ambitious chef in the romantic comedy No Reservations (2007).

3. Title: Chicago (2002 film). Fact: Chicago is a 2002 American musical crime comedy-drama film based on the stage-musical of the same name. It explores the themes of celebrity, scandal, and corruption in Chicago during the Jazz Age. The film stars Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere. "Chicago" centers on Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Zellweger), two murderesses who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s Chicago. Velma, a vaudevillian, and Roxie, a housewife, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows. The film marks the theatrical directorial debut of Rob Marshall, who also choreographed the film, and was adapted by screenwriter Bill Condon, with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb. Critically lauded, "Chicago" won six Academy Awards in 2003, including Best Picture, the first musical to win Best Picture since "Oliver!" in 1968.

4. Title: Chicago: Music from the Miramax Motion Picture. Fact: Chicago: Music From the Miramax Motion Picture is a soundtrack album featuring all of the original songs of the 2002 Best Picture Academy Award-winning musical film "Chicago" starring Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, Mýa Harrison and Christine Baranski.

5. Title: Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2003. Fact: Peter Jackson's final part of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy "The Return of the King" and Sofia Coppola's "Lost in Translation" both won three awards.

Question: who sang the theme song beauty and the beast
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Beauty and the Beast (Disney song). Fact: "Beauty and the Beast" is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for the Disney animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better. Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a "tale as old as time". Lansbury's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast, while a shorted chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film, and the song's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken's film score. "Beauty and the Beast" was subsequently recorded as a pop duet by Canadian singer Celine Dion and American singer Peabo Bryson, and released as the only single from the film's soundtrack on November 25, 1991.

2. Title: Belle (Disney song). Fact: "Belle" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman for Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film "Beauty and the Beast" (1991). Originally recorded by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara and American actor Richard White, "Belle", a mid-tempo French and classical music-inspired song, incorporates both Broadway and musical theatre elements. The film's first song and opening number, "Belle" appears during "Beauty and the Beast "as a large scale operetta-style production number that introduces the film's heroine Belle, considered a book-loving nonconformist by the townspeople of the village, who has grown weary of the provincial life in which she is supposed to live, and Gaston, the film's narcissistic villain who wishes to desire her hand in marriage despite Belle's repeated rejections.

3. Title: Beauty and the Beast (musical). Fact: Beauty and the Beast is a musical with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, and book by Linda Woolverton. Adapted from Walt Disney Pictures' Academy Award-winning 1991 animated musical film of the same name – which in turn had been based on the classic French fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont – "Beauty and the Beast" tells the story of a cold-blooded prince who has been magically transformed into an unsightly creature as punishment for his selfish ways. To revert into his true human form, the Beast must first learn to love a bright, beautiful young woman whom he has imprisoned in his enchanted castle before it is too late.

4. Title: Evermore (Beauty and the Beast song). Fact: "Evermore" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical fantasy film "Beauty and the Beast" (2017), a live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name. Originally recorded for the film by English actor Dan Stevens, who performs the song in his starring role as the titular Beast, "Evermore" was first released as a single by American singer Josh Groban on March 3, 2017. Stevens' version became available on March 10, 2017 when the film's soundtrack was released online, while Groban's cover is played during the film's closing credits.

5. Title: Gaston (song). Fact: "Gaston" is a song from the 1991 Disney animated film "Beauty and the Beast". A short reprise is performed later in the musical.

Question: was the revolutionary war before the declaration of independence
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: American Revolutionary War. Fact: The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also known as the American War of Independence, was a war between Great Britain and its Thirteen Colonies in North America which declared independence in July 1776 as the United States of America.

2. Title: History of the United States (1776–1789). Fact: Between 1776 and 1789 thirteen British colonies emerged as a new independent nation that would be eventually known as The United States of America. The Second Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, formally launching the American Revolutionary War, the fighting of which had already started between colonial militias and the British Army in 1775. Under the leadership of General George Washington, the Continental Army and Navy defeated the British military securing the independence of the thirteen colonies. In 1789, Federalists replaced the Articles of Confederation, passed in 1777 as the original governing agreement between the newly independent states, with the Constitution of the United States of America, which with amendments remains the fundamental governing law of the United States today.

3. Title: American Revolutionary War. Fact: After 1765, growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies. Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony. Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves, and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress (with the exception of Georgia) to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.

4. Title: American Revolution. Fact: The American Revolution was a colonial revolt which occurred between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) with the assistance of France, winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America.

5. Title: Timeline of the American Revolution. Fact: Timeline of the American Revolution — timeline of the political upheaval culminating in the 18th century in which Thirteen Colonies in North America joined together for independence from the British Empire, and after victory in the Revolutionary War combined to form the United States of America. The American Revolution includes political, social, and military aspects. The revolutionary era is generally considered to have begun with the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 and ended with the ratification of the United States Bill of Rights in 1791. The military phase of the revolution, the American Revolutionary War, lasted from 1775 to 1783.

Question: which group is responsible for adopting the declaration of independence
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: United States Declaration of Independence. Fact: The United States Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. These states would found a new nation – the United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence.

2. Title: Adopting Act of 1729. Fact: The Adopting Act of 1729 is an act of the Synod of Philadelphia that made the Westminster Standards, particularly the Westminster Confession of Faith, the official confessional statements for Presbyterian churches in colonial America. Presbyterian ministers were required to believe or "subscribe" to the "essential and necessary" parts of the standards, but defining what was essential and necessary was left to individual presbyteries to determine.

3. Title: Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Fact: It was adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 14, 1960. 89 countries voted in favour, none voted against, and nine abstained: Australia, Belgium, Dominican Republic, France, Portugal, Spain, Union of South Africa, United Kingdom, and United States. Except for the Dominican Republic, the rest of those countries that abstained were colonial powers.

4. Title: Declaration by United Nations. Fact: The twenty-two other original signatories in the next day (2 January 1942) were: the four Dominions of the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa); eight European governments-in-exile (Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Yugoslavia); nine countries in The Americas (Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama); and one non-independent government, the British-appointed Government of India.

5. Title: Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. Fact: The final draft of the Declaration was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, although the date of its signing has long been disputed. Most historians have concluded that it was signed on August 2, 1776, nearly a month after its adoption, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.

Question: What stereotypes provide the personas for Frito Bandito and Speedy Gonzales?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Frito Bandito. Fact: The Frito Bandito was the cartoon mascot for Fritos corn chips from 1967 to 1971.  The Bandito was created by the Foote, Cone & Belding Agency, and animated by Tex Avery.  The character was voiced by Mel Blanc, who used an exaggerated Mexican accent not unlike another character of his, Speedy Gonzales.  The Frito Bandito spoke broken English and robbed people of their Fritos corn chips, a reference to the "Mexican bandit" stereotype in western movies.  He also complained that he was being pursued by the "Frito Bureau of Investigation."

2. Title: Speedy Gonzales. Fact: Speedy Gonzales is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He is portrayed as "The Fastest Mouse in all Mexico" with his major traits being the ability to run extremely fast, speaking with an exaggerated Mexican accent and also speaking Spanish. He usually wears a yellow sombrero, white shirt and trousers (which was a common traditional outfit worn by men and boys of rural Mexican villages), and a red kerchief, similar to that of some traditional Mexican attires.[original research?] To date, there have been 46 cartoons made either starring or featuring this character.

3. Title: Comprachicos. Fact: Comprachicos (also Comprapequeños and Cheylas) is a compound Spanish neologism meaning "child-buyers", which was coined by Victor Hugo in his novel "The Man Who Laughs". It refers to various groups in folklore who were said to change the physical appearance of human beings by manipulating growing children, in a similar way to the horticultural method of bonsai – that is, deliberate mutilation. The most common methods said to be used in this practice included stunting children's growth by physical restraint, muzzling their faces to deform them, slitting their eyes, dislocating their joints, and malforming their bones. The resulting dwarfed and deformed adults made their living as mountebanks or were sold to lords and ladies to be used as pages or court fools or court dwarfs.

4. Title: Sidekick. Fact: Some well-known fictional sidekicks are Don Quixote's Sancho Panza, Sherlock Holmes' Doctor Watson, The Lone Ranger's Tonto, The Green Hornet's Kato, Shrek's Donkey (and sometimes Puss in Boots), Mickey Mouse's Donald Duck (and sometimes Goofy), Mario's Luigi, Sonic's Tails (& Knuckles), Donkey Kong's Diddy Kong, Daffy Duck's Porky Pig and Batman's Robin.

5. Title: Mucho Locos. Fact: A little mouse named Jose is depressed because he has no TV when Speedy Gonzales tells him to use his imagination. Speedy proceeds to say that the smartest animal is the mouse, and the dumbest the duck. Redrawn scenes from Chuck Jones-directed cartoons "Robin Hood Daffy" and "Deduce, You Say", as well as Bob McKimson's "China Jones" and a couple of Speedy cartoons, are used to evidence this.

2. Title: Michel Lotito. Fact: Michel Lotito (; June 15, 1950June 25, 2007) was a French entertainer, born in Grenoble, famous for deliberately consuming indigestible objects. He came to be known as Monsieur Mangetout ("Mr. Eat-All").

3. Title: Harry Foster Welch. Fact: Harry Foster Welch (November 27, 1893 – August 16, 1973) was an American radio and voice actor, best known for providing the voice of Popeye in cartoons and portraying the character in live performances beginning in 1934.

4. Title: Jack McCarthy (television). Fact: John Joseph McCarthy (August 13, 1914 - May 23, 1996) was an announcer and host at WPIX, Channel 11 in New York City. He is best known for hosting the broadcast of the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade for 41 years, and as "Cap'n Jack" for hosting WPIX's block of Popeye cartoons in the sixties and early seventies.

5. Title: J. Wellington Wimpy. Fact: Hamburgers are Wimpy's all-time favorite food, and he is usually seen carrying or eating one or more at a time – e.g., in Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor he is seen grinding meat or eating burgers almost the entire time – however, he is usually too cheap to pay for them himself. A recurring joke involves Wimpy's attempts to con other patrons of the diner into buying his meal for him. His best-known catchphrase started in 1931 as, "Cook me up a hamburger. I'll pay you Thursday." In 1932, this then became the famous, "I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today." The phrase was also slightly altered in the episode "Spree Lunch" to "I'll have a hamburger, for which I will gladly pay you Tuesday." This phrase is now commonly used to illustrate financial irresponsibility and still appears in modern comedies such as The Drew Carey Show and The Office. The initial part of the phrase was even the title of Episode 6 of the fourth season of Cheers "I'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday."

Question: did england play the 2014 fifa world cup
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group H. Fact: The group winners, England, qualified directly for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Ukraine placed among the eight best runners-up and advanced to the play-offs, where they were drawn to play home-and-away matches against France. After winning the first match by two goals, they lost the second by three and thus failed to qualify for the World Cup.

2. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup Group H. Fact: The two teams had met in two previous matches, both friendlies, most recently in 2003, won 3–1 by Belgium.

3. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup. Fact: The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organised by FIFA. It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America. Many fans and pundits alike also consider this edition of the World Cup to be one of the greatest ever held.

4. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup Group D. Fact: Group D of the 2014 FIFA World Cup consisted of Uruguay, Costa Rica, England, and Italy. This was the only group to contain more than one previous winner of the World Cup, as there were three previous winners. It was also the only group with three top 10 FIFA World Ranking teams as of October 2013 (ranking date for final draw) and at the start of the competition. Play began on 14 June and ended on 24 June 2014.

5. Title: 2014 FIFA World Cup. Fact: 31 national teams advanced through qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament (with Bosnia and Herzegovina as only debutant). A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil. For the first time at a World Cup finals, match officials used goal-line technology, as well as vanishing spray for free kicks. FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered a total of 5 million people, and the country received 1 million visitors from 202 countries. Every World Cup-winning team since the first tournament in 1930 – Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Uruguay – qualified for this tournament. Spain, the title holders, were eliminated at the group stage, along with England and Italy. Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals. Host nation Brazil, who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, lost to Germany 7–1 in the semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place.

Question: where was sycorax banished from before she came to the island
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Sycorax. Fact: According to the backstory provided by the play, Sycorax, while pregnant with Caliban, was banished from her home in Algiers to the island on which the play takes place. Memories of Sycorax, who dies several years before the main action of the play begins, define several of the relationships in the play. Relying on his filial connection to Sycorax, Caliban claims ownership of the island. Prospero constantly reminds Ariel of Sycorax's cruel treatment to maintain the sprite's service.

2. Title: Pelagia of Tarsus. Fact: According to tradition, Diocletian's son, the heir to the throne, fell in love with her and wanted to marry Pelagia. She replied that she could not, because she had sworn to preserve her virginity and was wedded to Christ. In his sorrow, Diocletian's son killed himself. Pelagia was sent to Rome by her pagan mother, where Diocletian asked her to become his wife. She refused, calling the emperor insane. She was then burnt to death, and her flesh melted and smells of myrrh pervaded throughout Rome. By some versions, she was burned within a Brazen bull. The story concludes by relating that the pagans sent four lions to surround her bones, but instead they protected her bones from vultures and crows until a Christian bishop could recover them.

3. Title: Aeaea. Fact: Aeaea, Ææa or Eëä ( or ; , "Aiaíā" ) was a mythological island said to be the home of the goddess-sorceress Circe. In Homer's "Odyssey", Odysseus tells Alcinous that he stayed here for one year on his way home to Ithaca. He says that he could not resist the need to be on this island, not so much for Circe but so that he does not resist the pull. The modern Greek scholar Ioannis Kakridis insists that any attempt at realistic identification is vain, arguing that Homer vaguely located Aeaea somewhere in the eastern part of his world, perhaps near Colchis, since Circe was the sister of Aeëtes, king of Colchis, and because their paternal aunt the goddess Eos had her palace there.

4. Title: Agathoclia. Fact: Tradition states that she was a virgin Christian slave owned by two people who had converted to paganism from Christianity, named Nicolas and Paulina. They subjected Agathoclia to regular physical abuse, including whipping and other violence, in an effort to get Agathoclia to renounce her faith. She repeatedly refused to do so.

5. Title: Ogygia. Fact: Ogygia (; , or "Ōgygíā" ) is an island mentioned in Homer's "Odyssey", Book V, as the home of the nymph Calypso, the daughter of the Titan Atlas. In Homer's "Odyssey", Calypso detained Odysseus on Ogygia for seven years and kept him from returning to his home of Ithaca, wanting to marry him.

Question: Who did the New York Giants lose to in the NFC wild card game in the 83rd regular season of the National Football League?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: 2017 New York Giants season. Fact: The 2017 New York Giants season was the franchise's 93rd season in the National Football League, the eighth playing their home games at MetLife Stadium and the second and final under head coach Ben McAdoo. Coming fresh off an 11–5 season from one year ago, the Giants had high hopes of a Super Bowl championship and were an expected playoff contender by many critics. However, things quickly fell apart after key injuries and controversial decisions towards the team. A disastrous and unexpected 0–5 start to their season (their second in 5 years), coupled with major injuries to the team, including star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., had the Giants suffer to a franchise worst 3–13 record. By Week 10, after losing to the previously winless 49ers, the Giants were standing at 1–8, their worst record since 1980. The Giants were officially eliminated from playoff contention on November 26, 2017 when the Falcons defeated the Buccaneers 34–20, the Panthers defeated the Jets 35–27 and the Eagles defeated the Bears 31–3.

2. Title: 2018 New York Giants season. Fact: The 2018 season was the New York Giants' 94th in the National Football League, their ninth playing their home games at MetLife Stadium and their first under head coach Pat Shurmur. The Giants entered the season looking to improve on their 2017 campaign, which saw the team finish with a 3–13 record, their worst since the adoption of a 16-game regular season. Despite starting 1–7 for the second consecutive year, the Giants managed to improve on their 3–13 campaign with a 30–27 win over the Chicago Bears. After a 17–0 shutout loss to the Titans in Week 15, the Giants missed the playoffs for the second straight season. The season was highlighted by blown fourth-quarter leads much like 2015, the Giants were in 12 one-possession games and lost eight games by seven points or fewer. The Giants finished the season 5–11 and last place in the NFC East for the second straight year and the first time they finished last in back to back years since 1977 and 1978.

3. Title: 2002 New York Giants season. Fact: The 2002 New York Giants season was the team's 78th season in the National Football League. The team improved upon their previous season's 7–9 disappointment, winning ten games and returning to the playoffs for the second time in three years, ending the season on a four-game winning streak.    After a midseason slump, head coach Jim Fassel stripped offensive coordinator Sean Payton of playcalling duties, and the Giants went on to a winning streak that would carry them to the playoffs.  Leading 35–14 in the third quarter of the NFC wild card came at San Francisco, Jeremy Shockey dropped a touchdown pass forcing a field goal to make the score 38–14.  Fassel decided to rest starting running back Tiki Barber to save him for the next round, but the 49ers gained momentum, and the Giants did not score again, losing the game 39–38.  Following the season, Payton was not retained; he won the Super Bowl seven years later as the head coach of the New Orleans Saints.

4. Title: 2016 New York Giants season. Fact: The Giants began 2–0 before falling into a three-game losing streak to the Redskins, Vikings and Packers. The Giants rebounded and went on a six-game winning streak for the first time since 2010, before falling to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 13. The Giants then upset the 11–1 Dallas Cowboys in Week 14 to improve to 9–4. With their Week 14 win over the Dallas Cowboys, the Giants clinched a winning season for the first time since 2012 and also swept the Cowboys for the first time since 2011. The Giants got their 10th win of the season in Week 15, having a 10 win season for the first time since 2010. Their 7–1 record at home is their best home record since MetLife Stadium opened in 2010.

5. Title: 2016 New York Giants season. Fact: The New York Giants season was the franchise's 92nd season in the National Football League, their seventh season playing their home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and the first under head coach Ben McAdoo.

Question: which large australian bird lays big green eggs
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Australasian figbird. Fact: The Australasian figbird ("Sphecotheres vieilloti"), also known as the "green figbird" (not to be confused with the Timor figbird), is a conspicuous, medium-sized passerine bird native to a wide range of wooded habitats in northern and eastern Australia, southern New Guinea, and the Kai Islands. It is common in large parts of its range, and occurs in numerous protected areas. Consequently, it is rated as Least Concern by BirdLife International and the IUCN.

2. Title: Malleefowl. Fact: The malleefowl ("Leipoa ocellata") is a stocky ground-dwelling Australian bird about the size of a domestic chicken (to which it is distantly related). It is notable for the large nesting mounds constructed by the males and lack of parental care after the chicks hatch. It is the only living representative of the genus "Leipoa", though the extinct giant malleefowl was a close relative.

3. Title: Green catbird. Fact: The green catbird ("Ailuroedus crassirostris") is a species of bowerbird found in subtropical forests along the east coast of Australia, from southeastern Queensland to southern New South Wales. It is named for its distinctive call which sounds like a cat meowing, although it has also been mistaken for a crying child. The green catbird resembles the spotted catbird, which is only found in an isolated population in Far North Queensland.

4. Title: Emu. Fact: The sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around 1 mm (0.04 in) thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The eggs are on average 13 cm × 9 cm (5.1 in × 3.5 in) and weigh between 450 and 650 g (1.0 and 1.4 lb). The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, and the proportion of yolk to albumen, at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun.

5. Title: Pacific emerald dove. Fact: This is a common species in rainforest and similar dense wet woodlands, farms, gardens, mangroves and coastal heaths. It builds a scant stick nest in a tree up to five metres and lays two cream-coloured eggs. Breeding tends to occur in Australia spring or early summer in southeastern Australia and late in the dry season in northern Australia.

Question: when did labour come to power in the 90
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of the Labour Party (UK). Fact: Labour has had several spells in government, first as minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and 1929–1931. MacDonald and half his cabinet split with the mainstream of the party and were denounced as traitors. Labour was a junior partner in the wartime coalition from 1940–1945. After the famous 1945 general election landslide under Clement Attlee (1945–1951) it set up the welfare state with the National Health Service, nationalised a fifth of the economy, joined NATO and opposed the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Under Harold Wilson in 1964–1970 it promoted economic modernisation. Labour was in government again in 1974–1979 under Wilson and then James Callaghan. Escalating economic crises (the "Winter of Discontent") and a split with David Owen and others forming the Social Democratic Party, resulted in opposition status during the Thatcher years from 1979–1990.

2. Title: Labour government, 1974–1979. Fact: The Labour Party governed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1974 to 1979. During this period, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan were successively appointed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by Queen Elizabeth II. The end of the Callaghan ministry was presaged by the Winter of Discontent, a period of serious industrial discontent. This was followed by the election of Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher in 1979.

3. Title: 1988 Labour Party leadership election (UK). Fact: Kinnock won the election with 89% of the vote and remained Leader until 1992, when he resigned the leadership after Labour's defeat in the 1992 general election.

4. Title: History of the Labour Party (UK). Fact: The British Labour Party grew out of the trade union movement of the late 19th century and surpassed the Liberal Party as the main opposition to the Conservatives in the early 1920s. In the 1930s and 1940s, it stressed national planning, using nationalization of industry as a tool, in line with Clause IV of the original constitution of the Labour Party which called for the "common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service" (this clause was eventually revised in 1994).

5. Title: Labour Party (UK). Fact: The Labour Party was most recently in government from 1997 to 2010 under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, during the "New Labour" era, first elected with a landslide majority of 179, reduced to 66 in the 2005 election. Since leaving government the party has been led by Ed Miliband from 2010 and Jeremy Corbyn from 2015.

Question: why did snape call himself the half blood prince
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Severus Snape. Fact: Before leaving Hogwarts to accompany Dumbledore in locating another horcrux –part of Voldemort's soul– Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney that it was Snape who overheard the prophecy and told it to Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself. Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. Enraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous "Half-Blood Prince" (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias Snape and pure-blood Eileen Prince). Snape passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book's end. The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape and the reason for Snape's actions remain unknown until the final book. In an interview, Rowling mentioned that at this point in the series, the Harry–Snape relationship has become "as personal, if not more so, than Harry–Voldemort."

2. Title: Lycorus. Fact: In modern fiction, one bearer of the name is Licorus Black, wizard in "Harry Potter", the first known member of the Noble House of Black.

3. Title: Tanacharison. Fact: Tanacharison (; c. 1700 – 4 October 1754), also called Tanaghrisson , was a Native American leader who played a pivotal role in the beginning of the French and Indian War. He was known to European-Americans as the Half-King, a title also used to describe several other historically important Native American leaders. His name has been spelled in a variety of ways.

4. Title: Captain Chaos. Fact: Victor is soft-spoken and unpretentious, but when situations arise that he himself is too timid to handle, Victor is compelled to don his satin cape and cowl and becomes the heroic Captain Chaos.

5. Title: Corum Jhaelen Irsei. Fact: Corum Jhaelen Irsei ("the Prince in the Scarlet Robe") is the name of a fictional fantasy hero in a series of two trilogies written by author Michael Moorcock.

4. Title: George Ferris Mansion. Fact: George Ferris (d.1900) was born in Michigan. He moved to Wyoming and pursued a variety of vocations, including prospecting, ranching and game hunting, as well as election to the Wyoming Territorial Assembly and the Wyoming Constitutional Convention. Ferris' wealth came from the Rudefeha Mine (later the Ferris-Haggarty Mine) in the Grand Encampment copper mining district. Work on the house began in 1899, but George Ferris was killed in 1900 when he was thrown from a runaway carriage near his mine.

1. Title: Fergus mac Róich. Fact: Fergus becomes king of Ulster after his predecessor, Eochaid Sálbuide, is killed, along with the High King Fachtna Fáthach, by Eochu Feidlech in the Battle of Leitir Ruad. While king, he desires Eochaid Sálbuide's daughter Ness, but she will only consent to marry him if he allows her son Conchobar to be king for a year, so his sons will be the sons of a king. The nobles of Ulster reassure him that the boy will be king in name only, so Fergus agrees, but Conchobar, with his mother's help, rules so wisely that the nobles make him king permanently in Fergus's place. Fergus remains Conchobar's loyal retainer, and becomes the foster-father of Conchobar's eldest son Cormac Cond Longas and nephew Cúchulainn.

2. Title: The Bear King. Fact: Two years previous to the present day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.

3. Title: Éogan mac Durthacht. Fact: Eogan was an enemy of Ulster and its king, Conchobar mac Nessa, but later made his peace with them. He murdered Deirdre's husband, Naoise, on Conchobar's orders. Later the bereaved Deirdre is asked by Conchobar whom she detests the most, and she replies Conchobar himself and Eogan mac Durthacht, whereby Conchobar decided she should go live with Eogan for a year. But the heroine chooses death over this fate.

4. Title: Fergus mac Róich. Fact: Fergus mac Róich (son of "Ró-ech" or "great horse"; also mac Róig, mac Rossa) is a character of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. Formerly the king of Ulster, he is tricked out of the kingship and betrayed by Conchobar mac Nessa, and becomes the ally and lover of Conchobar's enemy queen Medb of Connacht, and joins her expedition against Ulster in the "Táin Bó Cúailnge". The name "Fergus" (later Irish "Fearghus") means "man-strength" or "virility", and Fergus is described as being of enormous size and sexual potency. This leads him into many a precarious situation as in the story of the Táin Bó Flidhais.

5. Title: The Queen of Scotland. Fact: The Queen of Scotland tries to lure Troy Muir to her bed. When she fails, she directs him to lift a stone in her garden, and a hungry snake emerges.

Question: when does antony die in antony and cleopatra
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Death of Cleopatra. Fact: Cleopatra's death effectively ended the final war of the Roman Republic between triumvirs Octavian and Antony, in which Cleopatra aligned herself with Antony, father to three of her children. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt following their loss at the 31 BC Battle of Actium in Roman Greece, after which Octavian invaded Egypt and defeated their forces. Committing suicide allowed her to avoid the humiliation of being paraded as a prisoner in a Roman triumph celebrating the military victories of Octavian, who would become Rome's first emperor in 27 BC and be known as Augustus. Octavian had Cleopatra's son Caesarion (also known as Ptolemy XV), rival heir of Julius Caesar, killed in Egypt but spared her children with Antony and brought them to Rome. Cleopatra's death marked the end of the Hellenistic period and Ptolemaic rule of Egypt, as well as the beginning of Roman Egypt, which became a province of the Roman Empire.

2. Title: Death of Cleopatra. Fact: The death of Cleopatra VII, the last ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt, occurred on either 10 or 12 August, 30 BC, in Alexandria, when she was 39 years old. According to popular belief, Cleopatra committed suicide by allowing an asp (Egyptian cobra) to bite her. According to Greek and Roman historians, Cleopatra poisoned herself using either a toxic ointment or sharp implement such as a hairpin. Primary source accounts are derived mainly from the works of the ancient Roman historians Strabo, Plutarch, and Cassius Dio. Modern scholars debate the validity of ancient reports involving snakebites as the cause of death and if she was murdered or not. Some academics hypothesize that her Roman political rival Octavian forced her to commit suicide in the manner of her choosing. The location of Cleopatra's tomb is unknown. It was recorded that Octavian allowed for her and her husband, the Roman politician and general Mark Antony, who stabbed himself with a sword, to be buried together properly.

3. Title: Antony and Cleopatra (novel). Fact: McCullough continues her "Masters of Rome" series with the seventh and final installment, "Antony and Cleopatra". The novel spans the years 41 BC to 27 BC, from the aftermath of the Battle of Philippi and the suicide of Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus until the downfall of the second triumvirate, the final war of the Roman Republic and the renaming of Octavian to Augustus in 27 BC . The novel, which was McCullough's last in the series, focuses mainly on the famous love story between Mark Antony, victor at Philippi, and queen Cleopatra, earlier the lover of Julius Caesar.

4. Title: Antony and Cleopatra. Fact: L. T. Fitz outwardly claims that early criticism of Antony and Cleopatra is "colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.":p.297 Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra's "wicked and manipulative" ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the "chaste and submissive" Roman Octavia.:p.301 Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes argument: "when [Antony] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, it seems as though Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him." Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide at the end and "would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero.":p.310

5. Title: Cleopatra Alcyone. Fact: Alcyone died of grief when her husband, Meleager was killed.

Question: who do you play as in metal gear solid v the phantom pain
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Fact: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an action-adventure, stealth game in which players take the role of Punished "Venom" Snake from a third-person perspective in an open world environment. The gameplay elements were largely unchanged from Ground Zeroes, meaning that players will have to sneak from several points in the game world, avoiding enemy guards, and remaining undetected. Included in Snake's repertoire are binoculars, maps, a variety of weapons, explosives, and stealth-based items such as cardboard boxes and decoys. Following one of the series traditions, The Phantom Pain encourages players to progress through the game without killing, using non-lethal weapons such as tranquilizer darts to subdue enemies. Players may traverse the game world with vehicles such as jeeps and tanks, in addition to traveling on foot or on horseback, and as certain locations are mountainous, occasionally, players can opt to go rock climbing as a shortcut. They may call for helicopter support against enemy soldiers or request airstrikes that can bomb the target area or change the current weather. Snake can call on AI companions—including Quiet, a silent female sniper with supernatural abilities; D-Horse, a horse with a customizable saddle for carrying more equipment in the field; D-Walker, a manned, highly agile mobile weapons platform that can provide heavy weapons support; and D-Dog, a wolf pup raised and trained on the new Mother Base to assist him in the field. The companions' abilities and their effectiveness will depend on the player's relationship with them. There is a large emphasis based on tactics in The Phantom Pain.

2. Title: Phantom Fighter. Fact: As a kung-fu master, the player must fight through eight towns filled with kyonshi (Chinese vampires), each with a unique town boss, until the final confrontation with an evil witch. An infinite amount of continues are available to complete the game.

3. Title: Metal Slug Advance. Fact: A survival training camp for new Peregrine Falcon recruits has just begun, where the recruits must survive on an unnamed island with limited supplies and weaponry. However, a large blimp begins to hover above the island, as General Morden's troops parachute down and attempt to build a new base, while successfully capturing many of the new recruits. Players play as either new recruits Walter Ryan or Tyra Elson as the survival training soon becomes a full-fledged assignment for the remaining recruits as they pierce through enemy lines.

4. Title: Metal Black (video game). Fact: Players control the Black Fly on their mission to defeat the forces of Nemesis in hopes of saving the human race. Players collect many small power-ups to build their weapon's power; they can then unleash a large beam attack that drains said power level back to zero. Bosses can also collect these power-ups and use similar beam attacks. When a player's beam collides with a that of a boss, it culminates in a spectacular reaction, the more powerful attack pushing the weaker one aside.

5. Title: Soulcalibur (video game). Fact: The game centers on the pursuit of the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge, now in the possession of a warrior known as Nightmare, who slaughters countless people to satisfy the blade's bloodlust. Other warriors pursue him either to claim the weapon for themselves or to destroy it, end his mass murder, and free him of its curse.

Question: who does tom marry in parks and rec
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Tom's Divorce. Fact: "Tom's Divorce" is the 11th episode of the second season of American comedy television series "Parks and Recreation", and the seventeenth overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on December 3, 2009. In the episode, Tom gets a divorce and Leslie tries to cheer him up, unaware it was a green card marriage. Meanwhile, Andy challenges Mark to a game of pool with the hopes of winning back Ann's affections.

2. Title: Tomcat in Love. Fact: As part of his irrational reaction to the end of his marriage, Thomas Chippering returns to his (fictitious) home town, Owago, Minnesota. Emotionally spent, he trespasses on the backyard of the house where he grew up. The current resident, Mrs. Robert (Donna) Kooshof, finds him but is surprisingly attracted to him. Donna rashly agrees to participate in Tom's madcap scheme of revenge against his ex-wife (Lorna Sue), her brother (Herbie), and her new husband (known to the reader only as "the tycoon"). Tom, Lorna Sue and Herbie have been close friends — or at least companions — since childhood. The proximate cause of Lorna Sue leaving Tom was that Herbie revealed to her that Tom has been keeping a lifelong record of his infatuations and dalliances.

3. Title: Tom Horton. Fact: Tom Horton was born in 1910, married his wife Alice Grayson on March 7, 1930. Tom was a prominent doctor at Salem University Hospital and fathered five children, Tommy, Addie, Mickey, Bill, and Marie. In 1968 Tom would learn that his son Mickey was sterile, and when he confronted Laura Horton (Mickey's current wife) about her pregnancy she told Tom that Bill had raped her. The two agreed to keep their secrets from Mickey to spare his feelings. In 1977, Tom had a heart attack and remained in the hospital for several months. In 1978, Tom was promoted to Chief of Staff at University Hospital. Tom Horton read poetry, which he wrote himself, under the name Norm De Plume. He also wore a disguise so Alice wouldn't know what he was up to. When it was discovered their first marriage was invalid they married again on October 17, 1989. In 1993, Alice and Tom founded the Horton Center, which ran out of their home. The Horton Center provided shelter and help to run-away teens or families in need. Tom last appeared onscreen on February 9, 1994 due to Carey's failing health. Following Carey's death in March 1994, the character of Tom died off screen on June 21, 1994.

4. Title: Tom Haverford. Fact: Now in 2017, Tom's Bistro has become very successful. After reuniting with his ex-girlfriend Lucy, he convinces her to move from Chicago to Pawnee and work at the Bistro. Shortly thereafter, they begin dating and he eventually proposes to her, which she accepts. In a series of flash-forwards in the finale, it is shown that Tom loses a great amount of money after unsuccessfully attempting to franchise Tom's Bistro. However, he later becomes a success again by writing a book about his many failures and how others may be able to achieve success.

5. Title: Tom, Dick, and Mary. Fact: Newlyweds Tom and Mary Gentry (Don Galloway and Joyce Bulifant) lived together in a new apartment that they could not afford on their combined salaries as an intern and a medical secretary. Tom’s best friend Dick Moran (Steve Franken), also an intern, moved in to share the expenses, but often became an irritant to the newlyweds as he "played the field" in the world of romance.

Question: Which single by The Doors was a number one hit on the "Billboards" Hot 100 chart and was released in the same year as "The Crystal Ship"?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: The Crystal Ship. Fact: "The Crystal Ship" is a song by The Doors from their 1967 debut album The Doors, and the B-side of the number-one hit single "Light My Fire". It was composed as a love song to Jim Morrison's first serious girlfriend, Mary Werbelow, shortly after their romance ended.

2. Title: Swinging Doors (song). Fact: "Swinging Doors" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Merle Haggard and The Strangers. It was released in February 1966 as the first single and title track from the album "Swinging Doors". The song peaked at number five on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles.

3. Title: Touch Me (The Doors song). Fact: It was released as a single in December 1968 and reached No. 3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 (their last Top Ten hit in US) and No. 1 in the "Cashbox" Top 100 in early 1969 (the band's third American number-one single). The single also did well elsewhere, peaking at No. 1 in the "RPM" Canadian Singles Chart and at No. 10 in the Kent Music Report in Australia. However, despite the band's commercial success the previous year, "Touch Me" did not chart in the UK Singles Chart.

4. Title: Green Door. Fact: The hit version of the song in the United States was recorded by Jim Lowe, backed by the orchestra of songwriter Davie, with Davie also playing piano, and by the vocal group the High Fives. The track was arranged by Davie, who added thumbtacks to the hammers of his piano and sped up the tape to give a honky-tonk sound. Released by Dot Records, the single reached #1 on the Billboard charts for one week on November 17, 1956, replacing "Love Me Tender" by Elvis Presley.

5. Title: Light My Fire. Fact: "Light My Fire" is a song by the Doors, which was recorded in August 1966 and released in January 1967 on their self-titled debut album. Released as an edited single on April 24, 1967, it spent three weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late July, and one week on the Cash Box Top 100, nearly a year after its recording.

Question: what did the european export from the caribbean
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: History of the Caribbean. Fact: Beginning in the 1620s and 1630s, non-Hispanic privateers, traders, and settlers established permanent colonies and trading posts on islands neglected by Spain. Such colonies spread throughout the Caribbean, from the Bahamas in the North West to Tobago in the South East. In addition, beginning in the 1620s, French and English buccaneers settled in places like the island of Tortuga, the northern and western coasts of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic), and later in Jamaica.

2. Title: Atlantic slave trade. Fact: The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from Central and West Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on labour for the production of cotton. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas empires.

3. Title: Triangular trade. Fact: The first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as copper, cloth, trinkets, slave beads, guns and ammunition. When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the Middle Passage from Africa to the New World. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the slave ships. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port, from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from Virginia, tobacco and hemp. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.

4. Title: Barbary slave trade. Fact: European slaves were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to the Netherlands, Ireland and the Southwest of Britain, as far north as Iceland and into the eastern Mediterranean.

5. Title: Slavery in the British and French Caribbean. Fact: In the Caribbean, Great Britain colonised the islands of St. Kitts and Barbados in 1623 and 1627 respectively, and later, Jamaica in 1655. These and other Caribbean colonies became the center of wealth and the focus of the slave trade for the growing British Empire.

Question: The electronic game of memory skill, Simon, was launched in 1978 at what former nightclub that is currently a Broadway theatre?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Simon (game). Fact: Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after they took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language was written by Charles Kapps[citation needed], who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.

2. Title: Neil Simon Theatre. Fact: The Neil Simon Theatre, formerly the Alvin Theatre, is a Broadway venue built in 1927 and located at 250 West 52nd Street in the Theater District of Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

3. Title: Studio 54. Fact: Studio 54 is a former nightclub and currently a Broadway theatre, located at 254 West 54th Street, between Eighth Avenue and Broadway in Manhattan, New York City. The building, originally built as the Gallo Opera House, opened in 1927, after which it changed names several times, eventually becoming CBS radio and television Studio 52.

4. Title: The Nervous Set. Fact: The Nervous Set is a 1959 Broadway musical written by Jay Landesman and Theodore J. Flicker which centers on the Beat Generation. A wealthy publisher and his wife from a Connecticut suburb explore the Greenwich Village of New York City.

5. Title: Magic Theatre. Fact: The Magic Theatre originated in 1967 when John Lion, a student of Jan Kott at the University of California, directed a production of Eugène Ionesco's "The Lesson" at the Steppenwolf Bar in Berkeley. The theatre's name came from a crucial location in Hermann Hesse's novel "Steppenwolf": "Anarchist Evening at the Magic Theatre, For Madmen Only, Price of Admission Your Mind".

Question: is a pinky a finger yes or no
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Pinky ring. Fact: A pinky ring is a ring worn on the little finger of either hand, which is also called the "fifth finger".

2. Title: Little finger. Fact: The little finger, or pinky finger (in American English), also known as the fourth digit, or pinkie, is the most ulnar and smallest finger of the human hand, opposite the thumb, and next to the ring finger.

3. Title: Finger. Fact: Normally humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed phalanges, on each hand, although some people have more or fewer than five due to congenital disorders such as polydactyly or oligodactyly, or accidental or medical amputations. The first digit is the thumb, followed by index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger or pinkie. According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not.

4. Title: Index finger. Fact: The index finger (also referred to as forefinger, first finger, pointer finger, trigger finger, digitus secundus, digitus II, and many other terms), is the second finger of a human hand. It is located between the first and third digits, between the thumb and the middle finger. It is usually the most dextrous and sensitive finger of the hand, though not the longest – it is shorter than the middle finger, and may be shorter or longer than the ring finger – see digit ratio.

5. Title: Thumb. Fact: The thumb is the first digit (finger) of the hand. When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit. The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is pollex (compare "hallux" for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is pollical.

Question: The Purcell Operatic Society was a company devoted to the works of which composer of Baroque-style music?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Purcell Operatic Society. Fact: The Purcell Operatic Society was a short-lived but influential London opera company devoted to the production of stage works by Henry Purcell and his contemporaries. It was founded in 1899 by the composer Martin Shaw and folded in 1902. Its stage director and production designer was Gordon Craig whose productions for the company marked the beginning of his career as a theatre practitioner. Their debut production of Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas in 1900 was one of the earliest staged performances of the work in modern times.

2. Title: Henry Purcell. Fact: Henry Purcell (/ˈpɜːrsəl/ or /pɜːrˈsɛl/; c. 10 September 1659[Note 1] – 21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.

3. Title: Handel and Haydn Society. Fact: The Handel and Haydn Society was founded as an oratorio society in Boston on March 24, 1815, by a group of Boston merchants and musicians, "to promote the love of good music and a better performance of it". The founders, Gottlieb Graupner, Thomas Smith Webb, Amasa Winchester, and Matthew S. Parker, described their aims as "cultivating and improving a correct taste in the performance of Sacred Music, and also to introduce into more general practice, the works of Handel, Haydn, and other eminent composers." The Society made its debut on Christmas Day, December 25, 1815, at King's Chapel (then Stone Chapel), with a chorus of 90 men and 10 women. The early chorus members were middle-class tradesmen drawn from the choirs of local churches. Only men could be members, while a far smaller number of women were invited to participate. In its early decades the Society hired what musicians it could afford and used unpaid amateurs to complete the orchestra or sometimes substituted organ for orchestra.

4. Title: Anacreontic Society. Fact: The Anacreontic Society was a popular gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London founded in the mid-18th century. These barristers, doctors, and other professional men named their club after the Greek court poet Anacreon, who lived in the 6th century B.C. and whose poems, "anacreontics", were used to entertain patrons in Teos and Athens. Dubbed "the convivial bard of Greece", Anacreon's songs often celebrated women, wine, and entertaining.

5. Title: Handel and Haydn Society. Fact: The Handel and Haydn Society, familiarly known as H+H, is an American chorus and period instrument orchestra based in Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 1815, it is the third oldest musical organization in the United States after the Stoughton Musical Society (founded in 1786) and the U.S. Marine Band (founded 1798), and the oldest continually performing arts organization in the United States.

Question: what are the 7 deadly sins in bible
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Seven deadly sins. Fact: The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).

2. Title: Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. Fact: The Seven Deadly Sins are seven powerful demons, based upon the seven deadly sins enumerated in Christianity, who can take control of both humans and superheroes. The Sins were captured by the wizard Shazam many years ago, and encased in seven mockingly cartoon-like stone statues. The seven statues housing each demon are on display in Shazam's underground lair in the subway in the original comics, and in the Rock of Eternity in the modern comics. The demons have escaped their prisons several times to cause havoc, usually freed by another villain.

3. Title: Eternal sin. Fact: In Christian hamartiology, eternal sins, unforgivable sins, unpardonable sins, or ultimate sins are sins which will not be forgiven by God. One eternal or unforgivable sin (blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) is specified in several passages of the Synoptic Gospels, including , , and .

4. Title: Eternal sin. Fact: In Catholic teaching there are six sins that blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. They are:

5. Title: Seven Laws of Noah. Fact: According to Jewish tradition, non-Jews who adhere to these laws because they were given by Moses are said to be followers of Noahidism and regarded as righteous gentiles, who are assured of a place in "Olam Haba" (, the world to come), the final reward of the righteous.

Fact: Ciarán Joseph Griffiths (; born 3 March 1983; Manchester, England) is an English actor, best known for his roles as Gary Best in "The Bill" and Micky Maguire in "Shameless". In 2018, he made a guest appearance in BBC soap opera "EastEnders", playing the role of Milo from 1 January to 2 January.

5. Title: Sinchronicity. Fact: Sinchronicity is a six-part drama series broadcast on BBC Three in the United Kingdom (16 July 2006 — 20 August 2006). Set in Manchester, the programme is narrated by Nathan (Paul Chequer) and focuses on the love triangle of him, Fi (Jemima Rooper), and Jase (Daniel Percival). The programme is executive produced by Julian Murphy, who was an executive producer on Channel 4's "As If" and "Sugar Rush" and Sky One's "Hex". Stylistically similar to "As If", following a non-linear narrative, it also features ex-cast members Paul Chequer, Jemima Rooper and Mark Smith and, as such, can be seen as its spiritual successor. The theme tune is "Boys Will Be Boys" by the Ordinary Boys. The show was filmed in high definition and was re-run on BBC HD in mid-October 2006.

Question: all time top scorer for france national team
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: List of leading goalscorers for the France national football team. Fact: As hundreds of players have played for the team since it started officially registering its players in 1904, only players with 10 or more official goals are included.

Henry is followed by Platini, who scored 41 goals, David Trézéguet, who netted 34 goals, Olivier Giroud with 32 goals and Zinedine Zidane, with 31 goals. Henry, Trézéguet, and Zidane were members of the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, while Platini captained France to victory at UEFA Euro 1984.

2. Title: List of Ligue 1 top scorers. Fact: The following is the list of French Ligue 1 top scorers by season, since the inception of the French First Division in 1932 until the present day. Josip Skoblar holds the record for most goals in a single season at 44. Carlos Bianchi, Delio Onnis and Jean-Pierre Papin share the record for most awards won, with five wins each. The latest top scorer of Ligue 1 is Kylian Mbappé of Paris Saint-Germain.

3. Title: List of international goals scored by Eusébio. Fact: He remained the national team's top scorer of all time until his record was broken by Pauleta in 2005; he is now third with the record being held by Cristiano Ronaldo.

5. Title: List of international goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Fact: On 5 March 2014, he scored twice in Portugal's 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon to take his tally to 49 goals, thus becoming his country's all-time leading goalscorer, surpassing the 47 set by Pauleta.

Question: when did indiana jones ride open at disneyland
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Indiana Jones Adventure. Fact: The attraction premiered as Temple of the Forbidden Eye at Disneyland in Anaheim, California on March 3, 1995, and opened to the general public on March 4, 1995. A second, and nearly identical, version of the ride opened as Temple of the Crystal Skull on September 4, 2001 at Tokyo DisneySea in Chiba, Japan, unrelated to the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

2. Title: Safari Skyway. Fact: "Safari Skyway" was opened in 1986, as one of the first rides to open at Chessington World of Adventures. Safari Skyway's entrance was towards the back of the Market Square area, and the monorail gave a guided tour of the zoo, lawn and mansion area. In later years of the ride's operation, maintenance of the aging monorail system became difficult, and it suffered frequent breakdowns, including an incident in 2009 when a park-wide power cut stranded the monorail cars mid-route, forcing those inside to be rescued by a cherry picker.

3. Title: Enchanted Forest (Maryland). Fact: The Enchanted Forest officially opened on August 15, 1955, following a preview party the afternoon before — one month after Disneyland Park's opening. Appealing mostly to families with small children, the park had a nursery rhyme theme. The park featured fairy tale buildings and characters, but no mechanical rides originally. Track rides were added later, including the Alice in Wonderland ride with teacup-shaped cars, a Cinderella's castle ride with mice for the cars, the "Little Toot" boat that took children to Mount Vesuvius for giant slides, and the Jungleland Safari which was driven by open Land Rover-type vehicles. Children's birthday parties were often held in the picnic areas among the attractions; many local teenagers worked as ticket-takers at the park. Unlike many other attractions of the time, the Enchanted Forest was integrated from the day it opened.

4. Title: Dumbo the Flying Elephant. Fact: Dumbo the Flying Elephant is an aerial carousel-style ride located in Fantasyland at six Disney parks around the world. It is based on the 1941 film, "Dumbo". The original attraction opened at Disneyland in October 1955, three months after the park opened. The four other versions of the attraction were opening-day attractions at their respective parks.

5. Title: The Great Movie Ride. Fact: The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride located at Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The attraction employed the use of Audio-Animatronic figures, practical sets, live actors, special effects, and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history. The attraction—which debuted with the park on May 1, 1989—was located inside the park's replica of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood's most famous movie palaces.

Question: What is the name of the Taylor Swift song which was number-one single on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart and the album peaked at number five on the "Bllboard 200" ?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Taylor Swift discography. Fact: American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's career began with a record deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and the release of her eponymous debut album the following year. In the United States, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and stayed the longest on the chart during the 2000s. All of its singles—"Tim McGraw", "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn", and "Should've Said No"—charted within the top forty in the United States and were certified platinum by the RIAA. Swift followed with the release of the EPs Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection and Beautiful Eyes, which peaked at number twenty and number nine on the Billboard 200, respectively.

2. Title: List of Billboard 200 number-one albums of 2008. Fact: Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's "Fearless" is her first number-one album and had the longest run among the releases that have reached peak position in 2008, spending 11 non-consecutive weeks beginning with the issue dated November 29 and continuing into the 2009 chart year. She is the only singer to have achieved the longest-running album as a country female recording act in the "Billboard" 200 history. Swift is now ranked fifth on the list of solo female artists with the longest-running number-one album in "Billboard" history, tied with veterans Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Other albums with extended chart runs include Jack Johnson's fifth studio album, "Sleep Through the Static", and Metallica's ninth studio album, "Death Magnetic"; each spent three straight weeks on the chart. Three soundtrack albums topped the chart in 2008: "Juno", "Mamma Mia!" and "Twilight".

3. Title: Should've Said No. Fact: "Should've Said No" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song serves as the fifth and final single from her self-titled debut studio album. The song is about Swift addressing her former lover who cheated on her. It became her second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, and was a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition, "Should've Said No" has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

4. Title: List of Billboard number-one country songs of 2017. Fact: In the issue of "Billboard" dated February 25, singer Sam Hunt reached number one with the song "Body Like a Back Road", which would remain in the top spot through the issue dated October 14. In August the song broke the record for the most weeks spent at number one on the Hot Country Songs listing, surpassing the 24 weeks spent in the top spot by Florida Georgia Line's "Cruise" in 2012 and 2013. Hunt's song was finally knocked from the top of the chart in the issue dated October 21 by "What Ifs" by Kane Brown featuring Lauren Alaina. Two months later, "Meant to Be" by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line entered the Hot Country chart at number one, only the fourth time a song had debuted in the top position of the Hot Country Songs chart. The song would go on to break Hunt's record the following summer when it spent a 35th consecutive week at number one. On the Country Airplay chart, Dustin Lynch had the longest run at number one of 2017, spending four consecutive weeks at the top with "Small Town Boy". Lynch tied with Blake Shelton for the highest total number of weeks at number one on that chart, both artists spending five weeks in the top spot. Shelton took three different songs to number one, a feat also achieved by Thomas Rhett. No act achieved more than one chart-topper on the Hot Country Songs listing.

5. Title: For Her. Fact: The song peaked at No. 17 on "Billboard"s Hot Country Songs for chart dated August 5, 2017. It has since became Lane's second top 10 on the Country Airplay chart, and his first #1 on the Canada Country chart. It has sold 780,000 copies in the United States as of July 2018.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Somewhere Only We Know. Fact: "Somewhere Only We Know" is a song performed and composed by English alternative rock band Keane, officially released as their third commercial single, and appearing as the opening track of their debut studio album, Hopes and Fears (2004) as the first single. The song was Keane's first major commercial release, becoming one of the biggest hits of 2004 worldwide and peaking on the UK Singles Chart at number three during its first week of sale. It was also Keane's best-selling single until "Is It Any Wonder?" in 2006.

2. Title: Only You Know and I Know. Fact: "Only You Know and I Know" is a song written and originally recorded by Dave Mason in 1970. It is a track from his LP, "Alone Together". The song was his first charting single, and it became a modest hit for him in the U.S. and Canada.

3. Title: No One Will Ever Know. Fact: Rose originally recorded the song with his String Band in 1945 for Columbia Records. Roy Acuff and The Smoky Mountain Boys were the first to release this song in August 1945. Williams recorded his version alone with his guitar while working in Shreveport in 1948 or 1949. By 1957, MGM Records was still releasing singles on the late country singer, including demos, radio performances, and tracks featuring overdubbed instruments, and while some became hits, though several, such as his duets with Audrey Williams, were of dubious quality.

4. Title: All We Ever Knew. Fact: "All We Ever Knew" is a song written and recorded by American folk band The Head and the Heart, released as the lead single for their third studio album "Signs of Light" by Warner Bros. Records. The song was written by the band and produced by Jay Joyce.

5. Title: Logan English. Fact: Logan Eberhardt English (November 29, 1928 – March 9, 1983) was an American folk singer, poet, actor, and playwright. As MC at Gerde's Folk City in Greenwich Village, he was influential in Bob Dylan's early career, and also recorded one of the earliest albums produced as a tribute to Woody Guthrie.

Question: HMS "Florentina", was the Spanish frigate "Santa Florentina", built in 1786 at Cartagena, Spain, she served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in which year, after the Treaty of Amiens?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: HMS Florentina (1800). Fact: HMS Florentina (or sometimes Florentia or Florentine), was the Spanish frigate Santa Florentina, built in 1786 at Cartagena, Spain. The British Royal Navy captured her on 6 April 1800 and took her into service as HMS Florentina. She served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in 1802 after the Treaty of Amiens. There the Admiralty had her laid-up in ordinary. She was sold in December.

2. Title: Treaty of Amiens. Fact: The Treaty of Amiens (French: la paix d'Amiens) temporarily ended hostilities between the French Republic and Great Britain during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was signed in the city of Amiens on 25 March 1802 (Germinal 4, year X, in the French Revolutionary calendar), by Joseph Bonaparte and the Marquess Cornwallis as a "Definitive Treaty of Peace". The consequent Peace of Amiens lasted only one year (18 May 1803) and engendered the only period of general peace in Europe between 1793 and 1814.  Under the treaty, Britain recognised the French Republic; the British parliament had dropped England's historical claim to the now-defunct French Kingdom only two years previously. Together with the Treaty of Lunéville (1801), the Treaty of Amiens marked the end of the Second Coalition, which had waged war against Revolutionary France since 1798.

3. Title: HMS Santa Dorothea (1798). Fact: HMS "Santa Dorothea" was a Royal Navy 34-gun fifth rate. This frigate had previously served in the Spanish Navy under the name "Santa Dorotea". Built in Spain in 1775, she served during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars until being captured while sailing as part of a squadron off Cartagena. Taken into British service, she spent the rest of the French Revolutionary and most of the Napoleonic Wars under the white ensign, until being broken up in 1814.

4. Title: HMS St Florentine (1759). Fact: St Florentine was a 60-gun coast guard vessel in service in support of the French Navy during the early days of the Seven Years' War, before being captured by Britain in 1759 and commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS "St Florentine".

5. Title: HMS Santa Margarita (1779). Fact: HMS "Santa Margarita" was a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. She had been built for service with the Spanish Navy, but was captured after five years in service, eventually spending nearly 60 years with the British.

Question: Which Beatles album begins with two songs that were released together as a single, including the first single A-side written by George Harrison?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Something (Beatles song). Fact: "Something" is a song by the Beatles, written by George Harrison and released on the band's 1969 album Abbey Road. It was also issued as a single coupled with another track from the album, "Come Together". "Something" was the first Harrison composition to appear as a Beatles A-side, and the only song written by him to top the US charts before the band's break-up in April 1970. The single was also one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on an LP album.

2. Title: Come Together. Fact: "Come Together" is a song by the Beatles written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. The song is the opening track on the album Abbey Road and was also released as a single coupled with "Something". The song reached the top of the charts in the United States and peaked at No. 4 in the United Kingdom.

3. Title: With the Beatles. Fact: With the Beatles is the second studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, exactly eight months after the band's debut "Please Please Me". Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon–McCartney and "Don't Bother Me", George Harrison's first recorded solo composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six covers (mostly of Motown, rock and roll, and R&B hits). The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.

4. Title: List of songs recorded by the Beatles. Fact: Following their signing with EMI in 1962, each member of the "Fab Four" contributed to songwriting. Their primary songwriters were the partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who composed most of the group's songs; lead guitarist George Harrison wrote 22 songs, including "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun", while drummer Ringo Starr wrote two songs ("Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden"), and was credited as co-writer for four others. While songs written by Lennon or McCartney were always credited to "Lennon–McCartney", the pair wrote many songs completely separately. These include "Come Together", "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Nowhere Man" (Lennon) and "Hey Jude", "Let It Be" and "Yesterday" (McCartney), the last of which is one of the most covered songs of all time. Artists the band covered while together included Chuck Berry ("Roll Over Beethoven", "Rock and Roll Music"), Carl Perkins ("Matchbox", "Honey Don't"), Larry Williams ("Slow Down", "Dizzy, Miss Lizzy") and Little Richard ("Long Tall Sally"). Cover songs were included on five of the band's core albums: "Please Please Me", "With the Beatles" (both 1963), "Beatles for Sale" (1964), "Help!" (1965) and "Let It Be" (1970). Lead vocals were also shared by the group, with Starr usually contributing vocals to one song per album. The group were known for their harmonies, mostly two-part, but sang intricate three-part harmonies on "This Boy", "Yes It Is" and "Because".

5. Title: 1 (Beatles album). Fact: 1 is a compilation album by the English rock band the Beatles, originally released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom and United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on only one CD. "1" was a commercial success and topped the charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies.

All except Albania and Macedonia have started accession negotiations. Kosovo, whose independence is not recognised by five EU member states, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates for membership by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, which generally precedes the lodging of membership application. In July 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker announced that the EU has no plans to expand before 2019 while Serbia and Montenegro, the most advanced candidates, are expected to join before 2025. While the others are progressing, Turkish talks are at an effective standstill.

3. Title: Member states of the Council of Europe. Fact: Article 4 of the Council of Europe Statute specifies that membership is open to any European country, provided they meet specific democratic and human rights standards. Nearly all European states have acceded to the Council of Europe, with the exception of Belarus, the Vatican City, predominantly Central Asian Kazakhstan, as well as some of the states with limited recognition.

4. Title: Member state of the European Union. Fact: In 1957, six core states founded the EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. On 1 July 2013, Croatia became the newest member state of the EU. To accede, a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic, free-market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.

5. Title: Enlargement of the European Union. Fact: The European Union (EU) has expanded a number of times throughout its history by way of the accession of new member states to the Union. To join the EU, a state needs to fulfil economic and political conditions called the Copenhagen criteria (after the Copenhagen summit in June 1993), which require a stable democratic government that respects the rule of law, and its corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the Maastricht Treaty, each current member state and the European Parliament must agree to any enlargement. The process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as European integration. This term is also used to refer to the intensification of co-operation between EU member states as national governments allow for the gradual harmonisation of national laws.

Question: who was responsible for the heliocentric theory that stated the earth revolved around the sun
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Heliocentrism. Fact: It was not until the 16th century that a geometric mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. In the following century, Johannes Kepler elaborated upon and expanded this model to include elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope.

2. Title: Heraclides Ponticus. Fact: Heraclides Ponticus ( "Herakleides"; c. 390 BC – c. 310 BC) was a Greek philosopher and astronomer who was born in Heraclea Pontica, now Karadeniz Ereğli, Turkey, and migrated to Athens. He is best remembered for proposing that the Earth rotates on its axis, from west to east, once every 24 hours. He is also hailed as the originator of the heliocentric theory, although this is doubted by some.

3. Title: Geocentric model. Fact: In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, often exemplified specifically by the Ptolemaic system) is a superseded description of the Universe with Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbited Earth. The geocentric model was the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle in Classical Greece and Ptolemy in Roman Egypt.

4. Title: Johannes Kepler. Fact: Johannes Kepler (; ; December 27, 1571 – November 15, 1630) was a German astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer. He is a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution, best known for his laws of planetary motion, and his books "Astronomia nova", "Harmonices Mundi", and "Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae". These works also provided one of the foundations for Newton's theory of universal gravitation.

5. Title: Helioscope. Fact: The helioscope was first used by Benedetto Castelli (1578-1643) and refined by Galileo (1564–1642). The method involves projecting an image of the sun onto a white sheet of paper suspended in a darkened room with the use of a telescope.

Question: who was chris tate's wife in emmerdale farm
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Chris Tate. Fact: Christopher Francis "Chris" Tate is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Peter Amory. The character made his first appearance on 14 November 1989, when he arrived in the village alongside the rest of the Tate family - his father Frank, stepmother Kim and younger sister, Zoe. Initially, Chris was a good man who ran his business fairly, but was left permanently resentful of his life when he was maimed in a plane crash in 1993, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. The character then became much more jaded and bitter, often using his intelligence and assets to exact revenge on those he perceived to have hurt him. The resulting disabilities he was left with made him realize that his wife Kathy only remained with him to fulfill the role of his carer, leading to their divorce. He went on to marry Rachel Hughes in 1995, but his growing lust for money and indifference for everyone else's feelings lead to marital breakdown and divorce. Chris then married former prostitute Charity Dingle in 2001, despite a 12-year age gap and the disapproval of Zoe, but Charity's selfishness and cheating behaviour ultimately lead to the deterioration of their relationship. Chris soon learned he had an inoperable brain tumour, and rather than wait to die, decided to take revenge on Charity. After ensuring Charity would be left with nothing, he made his final appearance on 18 September 2003, when he committed suicide so as to frame her for his murder. Although Charity claimed she was sorry, Chris's last words consisted of a tirade of insults towards her, before the poison he had taken killed him.

2. Title: Charity Dingle. Fact: The character has been involved in numerous high-profile storylines during her time on the show, such as her marriage to Chris Tate (Peter Amory), an affair with Chris's sister, Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell), the arrival of her long-lost daughter Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb), her affair with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), being framed by Chris for his death, giving birth to Noah Tate (Jack Downham) and her uncaring relationship and subsequent break up with Tom King (Ken Farrington), which led to her exit on 1 March 2005. Atkins returned to the role on 1 October 2009. During her second stint in "Emmerdale", Charity's storylines focused on her relationship with Cain, their get-rich-quick schemes, and her job working with Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson), whom she later married and divorced.

3. Title: Megan Pearson. Fact: Megan Pearson is a British actress who is best known for playing Jean Tate in ITV's "Emmerdale". She lives in Leeds, England.

4. Title: Kim Tate. Fact: Often regarded as one of the greatest villains in British soap opera history, Kim's story arc mostly revolved around her dysfunctional marriage to local businessman Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) - whom she had initially divorced after sleeping with The Rt Hon. Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon) in 1992. The pair later remarried after coping through the infamous plane crash disaster that occurred between the end of 1993 and the start of 1994. Their second marriage lasted until Kim embarked on a prolonged affair with Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey), which consequently resulted in the latter's death on Christmas Day 1996 - after Dave died saving Frank and Kim's son James, later renamed Jamie, from a fire at their house, Home Farm.

5. Title: Faye Lamb. Fact: The character was first introduced to "Emmerdale" by then-series producer Gavin Blyth in March 2009, played by Kim Thomson. The character was introduced as a 'mysterious' acquaintance of Mark Wylde, and as his story progressed, it later transpired that Faye had been married to Mark (who at the time of the marriage was known as Daniel Lamb). In July 2009, Faye moved into the village with her son Ryan who was earlier revealed as Mark's son.

Question: what are the two types of circular motion
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Circular motion. Fact: In physics, circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body.

2. Title: Motion (geometry). Fact: Motions can be divided into direct and indirect motions.

3. Title: Circular orbit. Fact: A circular orbit is the orbit with a fixed distance around the barycenter, that is, in the shape of a circle.

4. Title: Linear motion. Fact: Linear motion is the most basic of all motion. According to Newton's first law of motion, objects that do not experience any net force will continue to move in a straight line with a constant velocity until they are subjected to a net force. Under everyday circumstances, external forces such as gravity and friction can cause an object to change the direction of its motion, so that its motion cannot be described as linear.

5. Title: Circular orbit. Fact: Below we consider a circular orbit in astrodynamics or celestial mechanics under standard assumptions. Here the centripetal force is the gravitational force, and the axis mentioned above is the line through the center of the central mass perpendicular to the plane of motion.

Question: what was the first music video on vh1
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: VH1. Fact: VH1's aim was to focus on the lighter, softer side of popular music, including such musicians as Olivia Newton-John, Kenny Rogers, Carly Simon, Tina Turner, Elton John, Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, Sting, Donna Summer, Rod Stewart, Kenny G, Michael Bolton, Anita Baker, Chicago and Fleetwood Mac, in hopes of appealing to people aged 18 to 35, and possibly older. Also frequently featured in the network's early years were "videos" for Motown and other 60s oldies consisting of newsreel and concert footage. It was introduced on January 1, 1985, with the video performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" by Marvin Gaye.

2. Title: MTV Classic (American TV channel). Fact: VH1 Smooth launched on August 1, 1998 as a part of the "Suite" digital package, delaying the original launch date of July 31, 1998. The channel focused on smooth jazz, new age, and adult contemporary music. The first music video to play on the channel was a cover of "Makin' Whoopee" by Branford Marsalis.

3. Title: List of first music videos aired on MTV. Fact: This is a list of the first music videos broadcast on MTV's first day, August 1, 1981. MTV's first day on the air was rebroadcast on VH1 Classic in 2006 and again in 2011 (the latter celebrating the channel's 30th anniversary). The first hour on the air was broadcast again on August 1, 2016 and was called MTV Hour One, as part of VH1 Classic's planned re-launch as MTV Classic, MTV itself, and additionally streamed on the channel's Facebook page.

4. Title: Michael Jackson videography. Fact: In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular culture and the first African American entertainer to have a strong crossover fanbase on MTV. The popularity of his music videos that aired on MTV,  such as "Billie Jean", "Beat It" and "Thriller"—credited for transforming the music video from a promotional tool and into an art form—helped bring the relatively new channel to fame; MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R&B from channel's original 'rock 'n' roll only' format.

5. Title: MTV. Fact: MTV originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as "video jockeys" (VJs), but in the years since its inception, the network significantly toned down its focus on music in favor of original reality programming targeting teenagers and young adults. Despite its success, the network's programming and influence have been the subject of controversy over the years.

Question: Are Simon & Garfunkel playing outdoors in this picture?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Outside Today. Fact: The song's music video features YoungBoy staying inside of his home and avoiding a swarm of paparazzi with his then-girlfriend Jania, crew, and Birdman.

2. Title: The Flageolet Player on the Cliff. Fact: The Flageolet Player on the Cliff is an 1889 oil painting by French artist Paul Gauguin, located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana. It depicts a Breton couple on a narrow path precipitously overlooking the Atlantic.

3. Title: Picnic with Weissmann. Fact: The phonograph winds up, and the needle touches the record. A lawn surrounded by trees has a wardrobe, three chairs, a desk, and a lounge. The chairs are playing cards on the desk. A snail is on the record on the gramophone and causes a ‘bump’ every time the needle crosses it.

4. Title: If They Could See Us Now. Fact: The episode opens with Del Boy and Rodney explaining their latest holiday to a barrister. While at a Monaco resort, Rodney feels guilty about not taking Uncle Albert with them, but is reminded that he is staying with Elsie Partridge in Weston-super-Mare. Del mocks Albert's catchphrase "During the war..." as he heads to a bar with Rodney. Later, Del learns that the Central American stock market has crashed, meaning the Trotters have lost all their money. The Trotter family escapes from the hotel without paying.

5. Title: Two Men Contemplating the Moon. Fact: These German Romantic landscape paintings feature two figures in a dark forest silhouetted by a pastel sky. The works' dark foregrounds and lighter backgrounds create a sharp contrast. The sky suggests that the time is around dusk, with the waxing crescent moon close to setting. A dead, uprooted tree's dark roots and branches contrast with the sky. The jagged branches and stark contrasts seem to create a threatening environment for the figures, and are reminiscent of the imposing Gothic style seen originally in the medieval era, but revived in the Romantic era. The same can be said of the dark, shadowy trees and rocks surrounding the couple. The figures themselves are dressed in dark colors and stiff, somewhat formal garments, which also serve to signify their higher class. The works emphasize spirituality in nature and the presence of the sublime, which are major themes of Friedrich.

Question: What is located in the middle of the white circle with a blue cross on the Queensland flag?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flag of Queensland. Fact: On 10 December 1859, ""a light blue flag with a red St George's Cross and union in the corner"" (now known as the Queensland Separation Flag) was flown in Brisbane at eight o'clock in the morning, to mark Queensland's separation from New South Wales .

2. Title: Flag of Brisbane. Fact: The white, wavy lines in three of the six quarters of the flag may represent the river, which brought much commerce and prosperity to the city in the early days of British settlement. An alternative explanation is that the wavy lines represent white clouds, parting to allow the blue sky to be seen behind them. The three caducei in these sections, rather than their popular but erroneous association with medicine, again represent commerce, referencing the role of Hermes in Greek mythology in his capacity as the protector of commerce and trade. The remaining three quarters depict two pretzel knots and a star, with the stars representing the achievements in astronomy of Sir Thomas Brisbane, for whom the city is named, and the knots representing the 38th Foot (Staffordshire Regiment), which Brisbane served in prior to being named governor of the colony of New South Wales. The abundance of maritime symbols on the flag reflects Brisbane's early role as a river port.

3. Title: Flag of Brisbane. Fact: The flag of Brisbane is based upon the arms of the Australian City of Brisbane. The two primary colours used are blue and gold, with blue representing the sea and the Brisbane River which flows through the city, and gold representing the sun and the city's warm climate.

4. Title: Australian Honour Flag. Fact: The Australian Honour Flag is a special Australian flag that was created by the Commonwealth Government in 1918, as a result of World War I. It consists of a white flag, with the national flag in canton, a large 7-pointed star, and three blue vertical bars, with a red border overall.

5. Title: Flag of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Fact: The flag consists of a green field, with a palm tree on a gold disc in the canton, a gold crescent in the centre of the flag and a gold southern cross in the fly. The palm tree represents the islands' tropical flora; the colours are Australia's national colours; the crescent represents Islam, the religion of the Cocos Malays who make up a majority of the population; and the Southern Cross is a symbol of Australia and the Southern Hemisphere.

Question: What is the pattern on the ground below Mario in The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Mario Bros.. Fact:  "Mario Bros." features two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of "Mario Bros." involve only running and jumping. Unlike future "Mario" games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a "POW" block in the center. Phases use wraparound, meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side.

2. Title: Super Mario Bros. 3. Fact: Players control plumbers Mario or Luigi, who must save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser. As in previous Mario games, they defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers; they also have new abilities, including flight or sliding down slopes. "Super Mario Bros. 3" introduces many elements that became "Mario" series staples, such as Bowser's children (the Koopalings) and a world map to transition between levels.

3. Title: Mario Is Missing!. Fact: "Mario Is Missing!" is an educational game. The computer version is a point-and-click adventure game, while the NES and SNES versions have more of an emphasis on platforming. In the game, Bowser, king of the Koopas, has relocated from the Mushroom Kingdom to the real world, where he has set up his headquarters in an Antarctican castle. Bowser plans to steal the Earth's treasures with the use of the Passcode-Operated Remote Transportation and Larceny System (PORTALS), which allows his Koopas to teleport anywhere in the world. Bowser plans to sell the treasures to pay for enough hairdryers so he can melt the ice of Antarctica. Bowser captures Mario to prevent him from foiling the plan, and it is up to Mario's brother Luigi to save him.

4. Title: Scramble Formation. Fact: The game is divided in areas, depicting key places in Tokyo, such as Shinjuku, Akasaka, and Ginza. There are no clearly defined "levels", but at some points the player is faced by a giant mothership, which can be shot down by hitting its engines.

5. Title: Land Beneath the Ground!. Fact: Scrooge is worried about earthquakes damaging his money bin and is determined to find out what causes them. So Scrooge McDuck and his nephews Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey and Louie go underground. As they approach a huge cavern, one of the nephews is surprised to see so much light underground and exclaims, "The sun room of the mad march hare!" The ducks meet two types of underground beings known as "Terries" and "Fermies" that live in enormous caverns underneath the surface of the earth. The Terries and Fermies look like bowling balls with arms and a head, but no legs. They tell each other apart by the ties they wear on ribbons around their necks—the Terries wear bow ties and the Fermies wear four-in-hand knots. They locomote by folding their head and arms into their body so they become a perfect sphere and then they roll from place to place like a bowling ball. They are colored various bright colors. They have periodic contests on an irregular basis to see who can cause the biggest earthquakes. Terries cause earthquakes by rolling in massive groups of thousands against the giant pillars that support the land on the surface of the earth. Fermies cause earthquakes by gathering together in massive numbers and lifting up pieces of the Earth's crust. Whichever group causes the biggest earthquake wins the contest and gets the prize, a piece of Ancient Greek pottery that fell down a crevice in Ancient Roman times in the year zero (i.e., the year 1 BCE translated into astronomical year numbering, which includes a year zero). In an attempt to stop the earthquakes Scrooge steals the trophy but loses his top hat.

Question: How many women are on the poster for The Wolverine (film)?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: All-New Wolverine. Fact: All-New Wolverine is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics that debuted in 2015 as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel relaunch. The series is the first to star Logan's clone daughter Laura Kinney (formerly X-23) in the role as the Wolverine. The plot introduces Laura's clone sisters, the youngest of which, Gabby, end up becoming her companion during their adventures. The series has been well received.

2. Title: The Nine Ages of Nakedness. Fact: The film's publicity materials claimed the film featured "150 topless international lovelies;" however, as several female cast members make repeat performances in several of the film's stories, that number might be an exaggeration.

3. Title: List of X-Men films cast members. Fact: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult star in a series of films centered around younger versions of previously established characters, which consists of "" (2011), "" (2016), and "Dark Phoenix" (2019). They portray Xavier, Lehnsherr, Darkhölme, and McCoy, respectively, while Lucas Till appears as Alex Summers / Havok in the first two films. "" (2014) features both the original cast (except for Romijn) and the new actors. Evan Peters portrays Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver in "X-Men: Days of Future Past", "X-Men: Apocalypse", and "Dark Phoenix", with Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Alexandra Shipp appearing as Grey, Scott Summers, Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler, and Storm, respectively, in the last two.

4. Title: Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.) / Let MOMA Know. Fact: The event's acronym, W.A.V.E., is a nod to Flag Day, which is observed on June 14 in the United States. 400 demonstrators, wearing suffragette yellow and white, marched in front the entrance to MoMA's newly expanded 53rd street building; a well received renovation that doubled its gallery space and increased traffic to the museum. Demonstrators had three demands: that MoMA exhibit works by women artists from their permanent collection, that it display women's work in loaned exhibitions, and that it create a policy to acquire women's work in the future. The WCA created pins to parody MoMA's "Museum of Modern Art OPENS" staff badges, upon which they included the addition "But Not to Women Artists." Cards were distributed listing the names of 100 well known female artists who were not featured in the exhibit, including Alice Neel, Louise Nevelson, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Faith Ringgold and Louise Bourgeois.

5. Title: Face Forward. Fact: Aucoin's portrait subjects include Julia Roberts, Sharon Stone, Martha Stewart, Tori Amos and Aucoin's own mother. Little, Brown reported a 275,000-copy first printing (compared to 164,000 for his last book, "Making Faces"), and the publishing company had already ordered three more press runs by the end of the month, for a total of 425,000 copies.

Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Dexiosis.

2. Title: Third Finger, Left Hand (film). Fact: New York magazine editor Margot Sherwood "Merrick" (Myrna Loy) invents a husband (who is conveniently away in remote corners of the world) mainly to safeguard her job; the magazine publisher's jealous wife has had the last two women in her position fired after mere months.

Question: What position are Gary Zukav's hands in?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Jetliner position. Fact: The jetliner position, also known as the captain's chair, is a form of physical torment used in cases where the tormentor is unable or unwilling to inflict corporal punishment on the subject. The recipient is made to put his back against a wall or pole and place their feet eighteen inches or so from the base of the object. The feet are usually kept close together. The subject must then slide down the wall or pole until his thighs are parallel to the ground, so that his profile is of someone sitting in a chair. He may also be required to slide his feet back until his shins and thighs are at right-angles to each other, which makes the stresses upon the knee joints and thigh muscles much greater.

2. Title: Jetliner position. Fact: Variations include placing weight on the subject's head or thighs, or making him hold his arms straight out in front of him, perhaps with a weight clasped in his hands. The result is increasing amounts of pain in the thigh muscles, as well as pain in the knees and ankles. The benefit for the perpetrator is that this kind of punishment causes pain without any lasting marks or, under all but the most extreme conditions, lasting damage to the subjects.

3. Title: Arm recoil. Fact: The baby is placed supine, with forearm flexed at elbow. The elbow (forearm) is extended by pulling the hand; then released.

4. Title: Crucifix position. Fact: The crucifix position is a ground grappling position that involves being perpendicularly behind the opponent, chest against back, and controlling the opponent's arms. One of the opponent's arms is controlled using the legs, and the other using the arms, hence effectively putting the opponent in a position resembling a crucifix. This position allows for elbow strikes to the head, or if the opponent is wearing a gi, it allows for a collar strangle called the crucifix choke (in Judo known as "jigoku jime", 地獄絞, "hell strangle"). It is also possible to have the crucifix position in such a way that a crucifix neck crank can be applied.

5. Title: Supine position. Fact: Using anatomical terms of location, the dorsal side is down, and the ventral side is up, when supine.

Question: What is resting on Deepak Chopra's nose?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Rhinarium. Fact: The rhinarium (New Latin, "belonging to the nose"; plural: rhinaria) is the furless skin surface surrounding the external openings of the nostrils in many mammals. Commonly it is referred to as the tip of the "snout", and breeders of cats and dogs sometimes use the term "nose leather". Informally, it may be called a "wet snout" or "wet nose," because its surface is moist in some species: for example, healthy dogs and cats.

2. Title: Nasal sebum. Fact: Nasal sebum, also known as nose grease/oil, is grease removed from the surface of the human nose. The pores of the lateral creases (where the nose joins the face) of the exterior of the nose create and store more oil and grease than pores elsewhere on the human body, forming a readily available source of small quantities of grease or oil. The grease is a particularly oily form of sebum, thought to contain more squalene (CH) than the secretions from other parts of the skin. It is notable because nose grease is a convenient durable lubricant.

3. Title: Urdhva Pundra Tilak. Fact: Urdhva Pundra tilak or the tilak chandlo is a mark applied on the forehead by members of the Swaminarayan Sampraday It is composed of two elements: the “U” shaped tilak made of yellow sandal paste, and the red kumkum dot in the middle. It is applied after the morning puja by followers of the faith. Members of the Swaminarayan Sampraday apply the mark every day during their puja.

4. Title: Anatomical snuffbox. Fact: The anatomical snuff box or snuffbox is a triangular deepening on the radial, dorsal aspect of the hand—at the level of the carpal bones, specifically, the scaphoid and trapezium bones forming the floor. The name originates from the use of this surface for placing and then sniffing powdered tobacco, or "snuff." It is sometimes referred to by its French name "tabatière".

5. Title: Tabasheer. Fact: Tabasheer (Hindustani: तबाशीर or طباشیر) or "Banslochan" (बंसलोचन, بنسلوچن), also spelt as Tabachir or Tabashir, is a translucent white substance, composed mainly of silica and water with traces of lime and potash, obtained from the nodal joints of some species of bamboo. It is part of the pharmacology of the traditional Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine of the Indian subcontinent. It is also an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines.

Question: Is this picture of Margaret Court in color?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Portrait of a Lady in Red. Fact: Portrait of a Lady in a Red Dress is a c.1660 painting by Gabriël Metsu. It has been in England since 1828 and in the collection of Polesden Lacey since 1922.

2. Title: Portrait of Margaret van Eyck. Fact: Portrait of Margaret van Eyck (or Margaret, the Artist's Wife) is a 1439 oil on wood painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck. It is one of the two latest of his surviving paintings, and one of the earliest European artworks to depict a painter's spouse. Completed when she was around 34, it was hung until the early 18th century in the Bruges chapel of the Guild of painters. The work is thought to be a pendant or diptych panel for either a now lost self-portrait known from records until 1769, or of Jan van Eyck's likely self-portrait now in the National Gallery in London.

3. Title: A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. Fact: A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster is a painting made in 1815 by Pierre Prévost, acquired by the Museum of London in July 2018. It is particularly significant for its depiction of the pre-1834 Palace of Westminster.

4. Title: Portrait of Margaret Desenfans. Fact: Portrait of Margaret Desenfans is a 1757 portrait of Margaret Desenfans by the English painter Joshua Reynolds. It was listed as part of her husband Noel's art collection in 1791 but remained in her own family's collection until being sold by auction in 1930 That year Dulwich College commissioned Moussa Ayoub to produce a copy of the original portrait. The original then remained lost until 2013, when its private owner loaned it for an anniversary exhibition at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, which Margaret and her husband founded.

5. Title: Portrait of Anne Hathaway. Fact: The only surviving image that may depict Anne Hathaway (1555/56 - 6 August 1623), the wife of William Shakespeare, is a portrait line-drawing made by Sir Nathaniel Curzon in 1708, referred to as "Shakespear's Consort". It was probably traced from a lost Elizabethan original. The drawing is currently located in the Colgate University Libraries, Special Collections and University Archives, Hamilton, NY.

Question: What is the man on the left in this picture with Fabio Castro wearing on his head?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis. Fact: The main contributors can be seen on the album cover, which is intended to be a tribute to influential Beatles album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". Seated on the floor, Gilberto Gil holds the graduation photo of Capinan. To the left, drinking from a chamber pot, is Rogério Duprat. To the right, Gal Costa, wearing a yellow dress, is beside Torquato Neto, with a cap. Caetano Veloso is to the left of them, holding a picture of Nara Leão. Behind them are Tom Zé, on the right, and Os Mutantes, on the left (more precisely, from left to right, Arnaldo Baptista, Rita Lee and Sérgio Dias).

2. Title: Portrait of the Infante Don Carlos. Fact: Its subject is in a relaxed and elegant pose, wearing a black costume with grey braids and a thick gold shoulder chain with the Order of the Golden Fleece and holding a hat in his left hand and a glove in his right. The figure appears in the darkest point of the space and the artist added a 4 cm strip on each sides to add to its sense of authoritarianism.

3. Title: Portrait of Manuel Godoy. Fact: The portrait is an incisive psychological characterisation. The subject's self belief is depicted via his unusual reclining posture, the surrounding horses, and the phallic baton situated between his legs. The painting metaphorically places Godoy sitting at the apex of the Spanish government. The artist captures Godoy's arrogance through his posture, and the inclusion of Portuguese flags. The choice of lighting gives intensity to the piece.

4. Title: Portrait of a Commander in the Spanish Army. Fact: The sitter is Don Antonio Pimentel de Prado. He wears a sash known as a "bandi carmesi," used at the time by military figures to indicate their senior position. The use of the colour pink was reserved for the Spanish army, hence the attribution of the sitter as a commander in the Spanish army.

5. Title: Don Quixote (Picasso). Fact: The drawing is of Don Quixote de la Mancha, his horse Rocinante, his squire Sancho Panza and his donkey Dapple, the sun, and several windmills. The bold lines, almost scribbles, that compose the figures are stark against a plain, white background. The figures are almost laconic and deformed, and are dramatic. Sancho Panza looks up at a tall, elongated, gaunt Don Quixote, who, in return, gazes forward. Don Quixote and Rocinante stand nobly, but have a somewhat tired air. The figure, painted with heavy strokes, seems to have been changed multiple times as Picasso painted Don Quixote's torso, arms and shoulder. "The knight's head, capped by what would be Mambrino's helmet, is connected to his shoulders by a neck made with a single, thin line, and it sports a pointed nose and a long, equally thin goatee. He carries a lance in his right hand and the reins and a circular shield apparently in his left. Rocinante is the bag of bones described by Cervantes. Panza appears to the left, a black mass vaguely defining his round body, and sitting on Dapple who has a long, wiry neck and thin, long ears. Little attention seems to have been paid to Panza sketched in the same vein, perhaps because Don Quixote is the center of attention. Though the two figures seem to be standing still, the drawing is full of movement; the lines are exuberant and the overall effect is catchy and one of bright humor."

3. Title: Hermes Fastening his Sandal. Fact: The sculptures of Hermes Fastening his Sandal, which exist in several versions, are all Roman marble copies of a lost Greek bronze original in the manner of Lysippos, dating to the fourth century BCE. The identity of the subject, which may simply represent an idealized athlete, is conventional. No attribute in any of the surviving examples clearly identifies Hermes, who wears neither hat nor helmet; none of the surviving original sandals are represented as winged. A pair of sandals figures in the myth of Theseus, and when the painter-dealer Gavin Hamilton uncovered an example in the swamp ground called the Pantanello at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli in 1769, he hesitated between calling it a Theseus or a Cincinnatus. Jason's myth also involves a lost sandal. When Augustus Hare saw that sculpture in the Ball Room of Lansdowne House (the Earl of Shelburne having been created Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784), in Berkeley Square, he noted it as "Jason fastening his sandal."

4. Title: Sabaton. Fact: A sabaton or solleret is part of a knight's body armour that covers the foot.

5. Title: Hobnail. Fact: In footwear, a hobnail is a short nail with a thick head used to increase the durability of boot soles.

Question: What shape is the background image of the  Yes Boss (TV series) picture if the corners were flattened out?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Top-left lighting. Fact: Top-left lighting is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.

2. Title: Squigglevision. Fact: Squigglevision is a patented method of computer animation in which the outlines of shapes are made to wiggle and undulate, emulating the effect of sketchily hand-drawn animation. Tom Snyder of Tom Snyder Productions invented the technique, which his animation studio Soup2Nuts subsequently used in "Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist", "Dick and Paula Celebrity Special", "Home Movies", "O'Grady", and "Science Court".

3. Title: Hollow-Face illusion. Fact: While a convex face will appear to look in a single direction, and the gaze of a flat face, such as the Lord Kitchener Wants You poster, can appear to track a moving viewer, a hollow face can appear to move its eyes faster than the viewer: looking forward when the viewer is directly ahead, but looking at an extreme angle when the viewer is only at a moderate angle.

4. Title: Professor Yes 'n' No. Fact: Professor Yes 'n' No is a syndicated television game show which aired in the United States in 1953, in which viewers at home were the contestants. Its main claim to notability is that it was hosted by Bill Cullen, who was very popular with viewers from the 1950s to 1980s. Aired in a 15-minute time-slot (11.5 minutes excluding prizes announcements and commercials; by comparison, the usual running time for 15-minute series was at least 12 minutes excluding ads), the series was set in a classroom, with Cullen dressed up as a teacher. He would ask a series of true or false questions, and asked viewers to write down their response. He would ask a total of 13 questions, with one additional question asked by an announcer on the station airing the show. Viewers wrote down a 15th question of their own, which was used as a tie-breaker.

5. Title: Your Name Here. Fact: During the summer of 1974, science-fiction writer William J. Frick (Bill Pullman) is having a meltdown. Despite having numerous popular titles to his credit, Frick is penniless. His ex-wives and ex-girlfriends are hounding him, and the IRS has sent Agent Duke (Dave Sheridan) to investigate his property and holdings. Bikers are mixing meth in his garage and having drug parties in his home. His final masterpiece, an account of his collision with God in an East L.A. taco stand, is nearly complete and actress Nikki Principal (Taryn Manning) encourages his writing, telling him that it has the power to change the world. However, after an inadvertent dose of a powdery white substance substance, Frick wakes up to discover himself lost in a series of alternate realities.

Question: What does Beyoncé often hold in her hand while performing?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Handbra. Fact: A handbra (also hand bra or hand-bra) is a technique used by actresses, models and other entertainers to cover their nipples and areolae with their own hands (or in some cases the hands of others) to comply with censors' guidelines, public authorities and community standards when female breasts are required to be covered in film or other media. If the arms are used instead of the hands the expression is "arm bra". The use of long hair for this purpose is called a "hair bra".

2. Title: Jazz hands. Fact: Jazz hands in performance dance is the extension of a performer's hands with palms toward the audience and fingers splayed (this position is also referred to as webbing). It is commonly associated with especially exuberant types of performance such as musicals, cheerleading, show choir, revue, and especially jazz dance shows. In cheerleading, the position with arms outstretched and fingers wiggling up and down is sometimes referred to as spirit fingers or jazz fingers. Depending on the performance venue, both gestures can be associated with campiness.

3. Title: HandClap. Fact: The song describes the singer's love, passion and desire for his lover, interpolated with a chorus of the singer asserting, "I can make your hands clap!".

4. Title: Gloving. Fact: Gloving performances are called light shows and have become increasingly popular at raves in America. Elements of hip-hop dance including liquiding, finger tutting, and popping have influenced gloving, and many of the same dance concepts and techniques can be applied to the dance form. Prior to gloving, rave attendees twirled glow sticks, and before the addition of LED lights, glovers used plain white Mickey Mouse gloves, which reflected black light frequently employed at shows.

5. Title: Zill. Fact: Zills, also zils or finger cymbals (from Turkish "zil", "cymbals"), are small metallic cymbals used in belly dancing and similar performances. They are called sājāt (صاجات) in Arabic. They are similar to Tibetan tingsha bells. In western music, several pairs of zills can be set in a frame to make a tambourine.

Question: How many men are seen here in this advertisement for the Screen Awards?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Thanking the Audience. Fact: The film was designed to be projected at the end of a showing of short films. It depicted seven international figures—"a Frenchman, English soldier, German, Spaniard, Italian lady, Russian, and Turkish lady"—transforming into each other, each displaying the words "Thanks, hope to see you again" in a different language.

2. Title: List of accolades received by American Beauty. Fact: DreamWorks launched a major campaign to promote the film five weeks before the ballots for the Academy Awards were due. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies to reach 5,600 Academy voters. Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in "casual, comfortable settings" in voters' communities. The studio's candidate for the Academy Award for Best Picture the previous year, "Saving Private Ryan", lost to "Shakespeare in Love", so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of "American Beauty", to set up displays of the film in the communities' bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Dale Olson, who led the film's campaign, advised the studio to not limit its marketing to major newspapers, but to also advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills, home to many voters. Olson arranged to screen "American Beauty" to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters.

3. Title: Anthony Mandler. Fact: Beginning his career as a photographer, Mandler's work has been featured on the covers of major magazines such as "Entertainment Weekly", "GQ", "Esquire", "Men's Health", and "ESPN The Magazine". His celebrity portraits include, among others, David Beckham, Colin Farrell, James Franco, Heath Ledger, Ryan Phillippe, Eva Mendes, LeBron James, Taylor Lautner, Andrew Garfield, Kiefer Sutherland and Katie Holmes. For commercials, he has worked with international clients such as Nike, Inc., Motorola, Duracell and Cîroc.

4. Title: The Yes Men (film). Fact: The film revolves around "The Yes Men"—two anti-globalization activists, under the aliases Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno — who impersonate spokespeople for the WTO and affiliated corporations in order to secretly lampoon and satirize these organizations with elaborate ruses and fraudulent announcements of ridiculous corporate decisions, in front of live, unsuspecting audiences (usually comprising businesspeople, university student bodies, and/or the press). The film details the two activists' involvement in hoaxes targeting SimCopter, the 2000 G. W. Bush presidential campaign, McDonald's, and, most prominently, the WTO. The film also includes brief interviews with Michael Moore and Greg Palast.

5. Title: For Your Consideration (advertising). Fact: For Your Consideration is a heading frequently used in advertisements in entertainment trade publications such as "Variety, Backstage," and "The Hollywood Reporter", as well as outdoor advertising, direct mailers, and events in Los Angeles. They are specifically directed towards members of awards voting groups in the entertainment industry, like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that annually presents the Academy Awards celebrating the best in motion pictures, or the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences which presents the Primetime Emmy Awards for television.

Question: What solo part of nature is visible on this picture for Six Feet Under (TV series)?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: (attn dfct). Fact: The introduction features the title in relief with a moving ocean, set on a background of gray light. This is followed by a short montage of a television being shattered and the first skateboarder (Jack Olson) injuring himself. The audio used is "Epilogue by "James Pants.

2. Title: The Rocky Mountains (painting). Fact: Towering mountains are on the right and a lake is in the center; both are below a wispy, cloudy sky.

3. Title: Lindsay Dawson. Fact: Lindsay Dawson (born December 21, 1959 in Palo Alto, California) is an internationally collected American painter and a frequent guest on the Fine Art Showcase television show. He is best known for his idealized impressionistic paintings of women and children in beach and garden settings, and romantic (usually retrospective) Americana scenes.

4. Title: Art, Life and the other thing. Fact: The middle canvas depicts Brett Whiteley himself standing side-on to the onlooker, his head in motion and his hands grasping. In one hand, a black-and-white image of Joshua Smith by William Dobell; in the other, a paint brush, as he is painting this picture. His body runs vertically to the canvas with the left hand side being almost empty. The features of the figure are disoriented and exaggerated especially in the head, where Whiteley is showing movement. Because of this movement, the head appears very abstract. The arms, legs and torso are unrealistically long and lanky. The body is clothed in a two-piece outfit, all in white. As the head turns it becomes more real and solid, going from a mass of blurred lines on the left to being almost photo-realistic on the right. To add to the realism, Whiteley had added his own hair to the piece on the right-hand side. The background colour is light orange.

5. Title: Space Chair. Fact: The piece opens with a panning shot across a bleak desert, the Sun low over a mountain range on the horizon. Electronic swells play on the soundtrack over the ambient noise; there is no speech. In the foreground is an armchair with orange upholstery. This cuts to an overhead shot taken from above the chair as a team of handlers release it, and then to a shot revealing the balloon the chair is attached to. A series of beeps from the GPS tracker begins to sound as the chair rises from the ground, and a sequence of shots from on board the balloon rig show the contraption climbing higher and higher above the ground. A car races across the desert below, raising clouds of dust. As the altitude of the chair rises, the wind begins to whistle and the curvature of the Earth becomes apparent. The chair rises to the very edge of space, and the campaign strapline, "Armchair viewing, redefined" appears as the view withdraws to show the advertised product (an LCD television or a laptop, depending on the version) and the Toshiba logo. In the closing seconds of the piece, the camera cuts back to the chair as the balloon shatters with an audible pop and the chair begins to disintegrate as it falls to the ground.

Question: What does Ted Walsh have on his face?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: J. T. Walsh. Fact: James Thomas Patrick "J. T." Walsh (September 28, 1943 – February 27, 1998) was an American actor. He appeared in many films, notably "Good Morning, Vietnam" (1987), "A Few Good Men" (1992), "Hoffa" (1992), "Nixon" (1995), "Sling Blade" (1996), "Breakdown" (1997) and "Pleasantville" (1998). According to Leonard Maltin, he was known for portraying "quietly sinister white-collar sleazeballs" in numerous films, and was described as "everybody's favorite scumbag" by "Playboy" magazine.

2. Title: Ed Williams (actor). Fact: Ed Williams is an American actor, who played Ted Olsen on the TV series "Police Squad!" and in "The Naked Gun" films.

3. Title: Sean McNamara (Nip/Tuck). Fact: Dr. Sean McNamara is a fictional character on FX Networks' drama series "Nip/Tuck", portrayed by Dylan Walsh. His character opens the show with the trademark catchphrase, "Tell me what you don't like about yourself." His partner, Christian Troy, has been his best friend since attending college together at the University of Miami, which is partly why they went into business together. Sean is portrayed as the more skilled, yet more troubled surgeon, who apparently specializes in craniofacial surgery. He is often plagued by family distresses involving his wife Julia and son Matt. The two also have a daughter, Annie, and a newborn son named Conor.

4. Title: Alfred E. Neuman. Fact: Alfred E. Neuman is the fictitious mascot and cover boy of the American humor magazine "Mad". The character's distinct face, with his parted red hair, gap-tooth smile, freckles, protruding nose, and scrawny body, had actually first emerged in U.S. iconography decades prior to his association with the magazine, appearing in early twentieth-century advertisements for painless dentistry—the origin of his "What, me worry?" motto—and, in the early 1930s, on a presidential campaign postcard with the caption, "Sure I'm for Roosevelt". The magazine's editor Harvey Kurtzman claimed the character in 1954, and he was named "Alfred E. Neuman" by Mad's second editor, Al Feldstein, in 1956. Since his debut in "Mad", Neuman's likeness has appeared on the cover of all but a handful of the magazine's over 550 issues. Rarely seen in profile, Neuman has almost always been portrayed in front view, silhouette, or directly from behind.

5. Title: Jim Gaffigan. Fact: James Christopher Gaffigan (born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He was raised in Chesterton, Indiana. His material is often about fatherhood, observations, laziness, and food. He is also regarded as a "clean" comic, using little profanity in his routines. He has had several successful comedy specials, including "," "Obsessed", and "Cinco," all three of which received Grammy nominations.

Question: How many triangles are present on this flag the Scottish people use?
Query: Consider the following facts: 

1. Title: Flag of Scotland. Fact: Use of the flag is first recorded with the illustration of a heraldic flag in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's "Register of Scottish Arms," circa 1542. It is possible that this is based on a precedent of the late 15th century, the use of a white saltire in the canton of a blue flag reputedly made by Queen Margaret, wife of James III (1451–1488).

2. Title: List of Scottish flags. Fact:  A white saltire on a Pantone 300 medium blue per Scottish National Flag Code.

3. Title: Flag of Scotland. Fact: The flag of Scotland (; , also known as St Andrew's Cross or the Saltire) consists of a white saltire defacing a blue field. The Saltire, rather than the Royal Standard of Scotland, is the correct flag for all private individuals and corporate bodies to fly. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8:00 am until sunset, with certain exceptions.

4. Title: Flag of East Lothian. Fact: The East Lothian flag is the flag of the Scottish county of East Lothian (Haddingtonshire). It was registered with the Flag Institute on 13 December 2018 following its announcement at a reception hosted by the Lord Provost.

5. Title: Flag of Saint David. Fact: The Flag of Saint David has been used as a flag representing Wales (as an alternative to the Red Dragon flag), in the same sense that the crosses of Saint George, Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick are used to represent England, Scotland and Ireland (of which they are respectively patron saints). It is similar to the arms of the Diocese of St David's.
